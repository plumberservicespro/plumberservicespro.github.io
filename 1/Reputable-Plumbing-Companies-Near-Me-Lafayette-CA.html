<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the perpetrator. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
