If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.
