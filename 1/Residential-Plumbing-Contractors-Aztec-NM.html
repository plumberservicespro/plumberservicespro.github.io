<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Backpressure occurs when the pressure in a personal water system exceeds the pressure in the general public water distribution lines that can trigger typical flow to reverse. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
