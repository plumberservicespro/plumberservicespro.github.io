<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>

<p>Whether a water system is labelled "soft" or "tough" is dependent on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.
