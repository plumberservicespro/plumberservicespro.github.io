<p>You count on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, shower or sink. In time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are among the most common signs that your unit is at completion of its life expectancy, especially if they are triggering major flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>

If you're getting a rough-in or final inspection on a construction task or remodel, you can do a little online research so you can make last modifications prior to inspection day.
