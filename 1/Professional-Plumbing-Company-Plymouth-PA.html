Any driver who ignores a leaky fuel line is obviously at serious danger of becoming a fire casualty, Lavacot states, as gas is spurting from their cars and truck someplace. Like everything else in your house, your plumbing pipes will not last permanently. In some cases a little leak can be fixed, but often changing your pipes is a better long-term service.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.
