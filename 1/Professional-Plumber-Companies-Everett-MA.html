<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Everett MA</h3>

<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Everett MA 02149</h3>

<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue.
