<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Elba AL</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is very essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present regulations restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
