<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
