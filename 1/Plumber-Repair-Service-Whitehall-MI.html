<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the option is to repair the broken area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is essential to solve the problem. Other times a more substantial solution is required: repiping.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
