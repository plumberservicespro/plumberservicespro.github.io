Take it out totally and clean it thoroughly if the trap continues to leak. You can decide to clear the drain with the aid of an auger if you presume a clog. If your sink is blocked, water will drain really slowly; drawing from a minute or two, to even 10.</p>
<p>Do not put everything down your garbage disposal. It is necessary to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause jams and obstructions - think about composting or putting these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can congeal and collect in your drain too. After ending up cooking, think about putting leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
