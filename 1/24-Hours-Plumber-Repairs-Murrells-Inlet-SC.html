<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of preserving the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Running out of warm water rapidly is another indication of sediment build-up, because the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
