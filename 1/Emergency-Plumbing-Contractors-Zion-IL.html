<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
