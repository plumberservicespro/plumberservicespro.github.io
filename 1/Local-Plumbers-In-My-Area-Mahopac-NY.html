<p>The most typical approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another aspect, typically sodium. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about really low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
