<p>You are responsible for fixing or changing the assembly within 30 days if your assembly fails the annual test. All replacements need to be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right kind of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see section below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly should fulfill the lead complimentary requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be stopped until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Numerous homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their unclean or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are easy to use and affordable, but they harm your pipes and their effects are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will likewise gnaw at the pipe producing weak spots that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>
