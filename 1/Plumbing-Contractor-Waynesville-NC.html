<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is normally channelled in other places to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be prone to blocking due to the fact that there just isn't enough a high enough flow to flush out the particles.</p>

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
