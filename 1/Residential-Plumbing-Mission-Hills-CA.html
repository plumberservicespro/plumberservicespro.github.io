Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
