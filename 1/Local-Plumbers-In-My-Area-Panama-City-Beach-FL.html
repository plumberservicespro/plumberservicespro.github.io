<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
