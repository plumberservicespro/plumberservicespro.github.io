<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
