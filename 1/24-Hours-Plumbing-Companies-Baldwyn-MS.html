<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You have permanent water firmness if you don't see limescale build-up but instead see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as effectively or your skin getting itchy and sensitive. If you smell gas, do not try to locate the leak. Rather, leave your house or structure right away. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, home appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might produce a trigger. When you are in a safe location, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to provide decades of security. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, temperature level or turbidity can all trigger the assembly to weaken in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might seldom need repair while some are fixed on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
