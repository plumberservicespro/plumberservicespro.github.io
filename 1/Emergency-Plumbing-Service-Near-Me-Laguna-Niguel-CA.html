<p>Check the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four ought to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and offered for usage.
