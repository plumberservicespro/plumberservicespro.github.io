<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.

<p>When you get rid of the cap to eliminate the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and easy. But discovering the right washer might not be. The most typical washers are typically available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be difficult to discover. If you decide to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
