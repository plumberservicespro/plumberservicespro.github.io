<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leakages under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten as necessary. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as desired.</p>
