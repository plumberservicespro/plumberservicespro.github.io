<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Clay NY</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
