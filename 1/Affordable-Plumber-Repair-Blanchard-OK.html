<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than consistent or direct) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
