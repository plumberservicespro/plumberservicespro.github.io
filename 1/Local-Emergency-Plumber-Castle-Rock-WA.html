<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
