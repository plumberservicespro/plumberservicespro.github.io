<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
