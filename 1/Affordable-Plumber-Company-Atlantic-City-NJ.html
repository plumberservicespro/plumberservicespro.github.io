<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
