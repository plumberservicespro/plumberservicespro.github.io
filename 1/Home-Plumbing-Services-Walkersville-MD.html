<h3>Water Line Repairs in Walkersville Maryland</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
