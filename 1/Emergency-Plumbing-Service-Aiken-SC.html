<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Aiken SC</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally rare cases where the structure is deemed to not present a danger to the water supply, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
