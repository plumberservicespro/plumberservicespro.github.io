<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
