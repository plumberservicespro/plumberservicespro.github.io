<p>When sewer line breaks, it often triggers the lawn above it to end up being soggy. You may smell the revolting smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it necessary to cordon off that portion of your yard. The circumstance is filled with problems because the swampiness will bring in unwelcome creatures.
