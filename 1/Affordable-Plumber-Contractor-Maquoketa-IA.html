High water pressure results in leakages, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to take place without correct pressure decrease.

The brine tank holds a highly focused service of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.
