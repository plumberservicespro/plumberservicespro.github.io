Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
