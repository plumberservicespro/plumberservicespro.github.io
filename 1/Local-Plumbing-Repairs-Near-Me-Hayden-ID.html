The clearing of stoppages in fixture branches; the fixing of incidental leakages in valves, pipes or components; or the removal and reinstallation of existing or new plumbing fixtures, residential type plumbing devices, non-testable backflow devices, and plumbing appurtenances; supplied that such repairs do not involve or require the replacement of concealed piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
<p>There's an excellent chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in an option and is utilized to reveal the strength of the acidity of an option. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up rust Carbon dioxide will possibly contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
