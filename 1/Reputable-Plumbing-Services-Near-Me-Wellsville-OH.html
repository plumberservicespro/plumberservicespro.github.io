<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
