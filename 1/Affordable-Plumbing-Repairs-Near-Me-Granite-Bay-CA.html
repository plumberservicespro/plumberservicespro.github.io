<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is very important to enjoy what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause blockages and jams - consider composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and gather in your drain too. After ending up cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
