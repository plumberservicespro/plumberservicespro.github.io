<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
