<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.

Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
