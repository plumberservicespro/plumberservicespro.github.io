<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
