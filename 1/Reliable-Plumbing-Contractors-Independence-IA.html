<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
