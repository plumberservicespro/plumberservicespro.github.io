Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

<p>The most efficient way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The costs of water softeners are normally far exceeded by the benefits and cost savings obtained, through using softened water.
