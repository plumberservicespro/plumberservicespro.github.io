<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on security within a building. Plumbing inspections ensure that water supply in buildings are linked appropriately, without any cross-connection to pollute drinkable water systems. Components must be appropriately trapped, to avoid sewer gas from leaving into a structures. Warm water heaters are also checked to make sure that they have been set up correctly, to prevent a surge.</p>

The tank eventually loses its capability to seal effectively, producing waste and a greater water bill.</p>
