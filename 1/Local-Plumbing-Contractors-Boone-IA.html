You probably do not wish to collect your patio, parking lot or landscape.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for carrying out annual forward circulation tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them.
