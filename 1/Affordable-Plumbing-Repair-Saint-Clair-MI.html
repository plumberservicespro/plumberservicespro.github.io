If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
