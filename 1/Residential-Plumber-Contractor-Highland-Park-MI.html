A lot of plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that turn up will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site may affect the time it takes. Since carbon monoxide gets launched into the air while burning natural gas, these types of heaters can result in a considerable quantity of pollution.</p>
