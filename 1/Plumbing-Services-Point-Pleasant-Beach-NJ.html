<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the most basic of the 3 readily available methods. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need fewer repairs in time. Sanford & Child plumbing supplies sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. Throughout regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused service of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge.

When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank runs out of salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
