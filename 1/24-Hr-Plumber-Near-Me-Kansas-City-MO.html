Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic tanks or examining the condition of buried pipes to determine proper maintenance schedules or the extent of necessary repairs. When the corrupt salesperson takes control of the camera, he might play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in very bad condition and say it is your pipe.</p>
<p>It's difficult to figure out if you have broken or broken drains up until a video inspection is carried out. Split or broken drains are generally preceded by recurring blockages, consistent nasty drain smells or the existence of sewer flies. The primary step is effort to clear the blocked drain and then immediately check the drain. In some cases a smoke test can be carried out to reveal breaks or fractures. ZOOM DRAIN performs a complimentary peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
