Illness can result from ingesting water that has actually been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Storage facility also brings a broad variety of backflow prevention accessories. These devices consist of backflow prevention system attachments, backflow device enclosures, test kits, repair parts, and insulated pouches.
