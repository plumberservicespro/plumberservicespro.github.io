It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>

You can't constantly be particular whether the house has had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous homeowner understood the reason for the clog A simple camera inspection could make you familiar with a surprise and very pricey  problem prior to the purchase.</p>
