For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly.

Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
