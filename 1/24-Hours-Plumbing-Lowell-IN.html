<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the offender. But not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>It generally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you notice low water pressure or blemished water. As rust and minerals build up over time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The discoloration occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail below the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
