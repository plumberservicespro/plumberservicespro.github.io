<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a requirement more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to make sure no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
