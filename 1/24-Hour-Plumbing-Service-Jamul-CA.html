<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
