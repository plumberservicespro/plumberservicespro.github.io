<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals referred to as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually correct, a sink waste disposal system." Whatever you call it, switching one out or installing a new one is a fairly simple task. The work on specific mains usually takes one to two weeks, and service work generally takes an additional one to two weeks, though some might be carried out simultaneously on a project.

<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that opportunity.

Finally, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with a shoddy plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are exceptional alternatives to the costly copper piping.</p>
