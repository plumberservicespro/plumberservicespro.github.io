A pipe leak test need to be carried out, then there are two ways to proceed. The very first is with trenchless repair. The second is with a standard method.

<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to offer years of security. There are many local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.

Unlike residential swimming pools, public or community pools should utilize only RP devices or Air Gaps on their refill lines. An RP on a public or community swimming pool should be evaluated upon installation and then each year.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
