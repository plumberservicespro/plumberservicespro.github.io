If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed correctly (Image 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Because they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles however will lose more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regenerate after numerous gallons of water have been softened.
