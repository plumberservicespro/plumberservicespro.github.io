<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
