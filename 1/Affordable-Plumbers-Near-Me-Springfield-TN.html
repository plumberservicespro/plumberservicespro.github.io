<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of hot water is the most significant sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
