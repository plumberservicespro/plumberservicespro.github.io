Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
