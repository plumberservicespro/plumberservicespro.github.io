They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
