<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
