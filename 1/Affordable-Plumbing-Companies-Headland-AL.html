<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it.

However while little drips need to not be cause for issue, house owners need to keep an eye on the water heater leaks. When we required a leak in a pipe fixed, I had a fantastic experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was friendly and professional. He also did the job faster than original estimated, so the work was less expensive than I prepared for. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>

Both consist of a mechanical backflow preventer - essentially, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were great at repairing the clogged drain, however really very careless about fixing the chip in the sink and the use of puddy under the sink.</p>
