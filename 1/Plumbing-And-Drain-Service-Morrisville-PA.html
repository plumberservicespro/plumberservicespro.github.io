<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
