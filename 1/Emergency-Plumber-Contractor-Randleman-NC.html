<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your alternatives. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular method of clearing blockages. They generally use sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to dissolve gunky build-up. While reliable at eliminating obstructions, they could do your plumbing more damage than great. Here are three factors to avoid putting these harsh chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the indicators of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in joists, floorings, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
