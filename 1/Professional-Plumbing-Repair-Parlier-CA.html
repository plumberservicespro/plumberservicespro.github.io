<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Parlier CA</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>
