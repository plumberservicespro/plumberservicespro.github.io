<p>Family owned and operated considering that 2003, RT Plumbing Services provides industry-leading plumbing competence, house remodeling service, and water heater conversions and replacements to the higher Fort Worth, TX neighborhood. Prior to installing, your professional will switch off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a brand-new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its install.
