<p>Wondering how much do plumbers charge to snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a great deal of variables that may come into play, here is how plumbers generally charge for drain snaking. The garbage disposal is clogged or slowly draining. While a waste disposal unit is an useful tool, not all food waste can be put through a waste disposal unit, causing obstructions. Some items that should never ever be taken into the disposal include fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a waste disposal unit is just geared up to manage softer natural waste. It might cause it to jam and not work properly if bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal. By running hot water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. Nevertheless you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line.
