Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.
