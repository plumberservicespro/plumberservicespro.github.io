Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
