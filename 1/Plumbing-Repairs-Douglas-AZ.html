<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Douglas AZ</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP).

If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
