<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers available that you may run into. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check".

<p>New designs of waste disposal unit might need to be hard-wired into a devoted electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't offered in an older house, employing an electrical contractor to add a circuit costs around $150-$ 250.
