It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water.

Sufficient drainage must also be provided.</p>

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly.
