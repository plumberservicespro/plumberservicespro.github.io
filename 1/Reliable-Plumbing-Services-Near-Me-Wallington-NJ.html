Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. If that doesn't suffice then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and safety cautions initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's readily offered at the majority of hardware stores.</p>
