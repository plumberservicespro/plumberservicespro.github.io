<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can trigger a devastating leak in time. Don't wait up until it's far too late! Trust our water leak detection solutions to fix your home's issues.
