<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you observe odd popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating component. Lacking warm water quickly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is taking up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
