Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
