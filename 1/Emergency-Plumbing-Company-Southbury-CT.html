<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Southbury CT</h3>

It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
