<p>When the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly protected, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Whether you're a house owner, business owner, or home manager, at some time you will probably need to call a plumber.

A bad plumber can be your worst problem in regards to issues that keep returning to bite you.</p>
<p>Lots of homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or unclean drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and economical, however they harm your pipes and their results are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize severe chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated usage, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe creating weak points that are prone to burst.

Place a pail underneath the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
