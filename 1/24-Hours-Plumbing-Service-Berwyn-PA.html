<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping.
