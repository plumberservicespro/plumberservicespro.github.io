<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Company in Sandston</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
