Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to analyze. You might need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is reasonably brand-new. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing companies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
