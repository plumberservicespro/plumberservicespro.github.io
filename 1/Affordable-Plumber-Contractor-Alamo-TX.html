Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
