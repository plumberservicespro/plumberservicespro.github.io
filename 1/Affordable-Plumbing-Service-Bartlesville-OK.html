<p>Water heater diagnostics: We identify what is incorrect with your water heater, in addition to what maintenance work needs to be carried out progressing. Water softeners generally use salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, likewise called brine. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that look like wet sand.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your hot water appears rusty, this might be a sign that your water heater is rusting on the inside and might start leaking soon. You can look at this by filling a number of five-gallon pails with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you probably need a water heater replacement.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
