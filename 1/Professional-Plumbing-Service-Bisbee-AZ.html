<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
