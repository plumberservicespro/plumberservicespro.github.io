Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
