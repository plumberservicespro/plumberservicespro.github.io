<p>When the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
