<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>That's why we at Big Blue Plumbing answer calls day or night to take care of broken water heaters and other plumbing emergency situations. We'll work to repair the problem and assess as effectively and effectively as possible, getting your hot water heater up and running in no time.

The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be irritating. The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to use but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
