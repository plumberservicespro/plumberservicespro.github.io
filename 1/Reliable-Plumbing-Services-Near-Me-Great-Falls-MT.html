<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Installing gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service.

The minerals that trigger tough water adhere to the beads, and the treated water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Whether you're a property owner, company owner, or property supervisor, eventually you will probably need to call a plumber. It's an excellent concept to do a little research into the world of plumbing before you call someone and turn them loose on your plumbing system. A good plumber can save your bacon.

<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or long-term connection between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health danger if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
