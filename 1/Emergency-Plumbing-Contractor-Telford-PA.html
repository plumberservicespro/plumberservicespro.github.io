<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and duty are extremely important to developing a track record for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no other way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Don't put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is essential to see what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause clogs and jams - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can gather and harden in your drain as well. After finishing cooking, think about putting leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
