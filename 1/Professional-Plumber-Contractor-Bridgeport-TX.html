Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to offer one, then we examine to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
