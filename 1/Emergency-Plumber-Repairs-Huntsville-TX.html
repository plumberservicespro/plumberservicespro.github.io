<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to blockages that come from inside the house. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems.

<p>Suggestion: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you discover water coming back in your sink or shower? This might imply that the water doesn't have a clear path to do through, most likely because of a blocked drain. This is likewise the very best time to add the cable and plug to your disposal.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
