<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less crucial things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
