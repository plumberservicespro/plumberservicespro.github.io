<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber New Brighton PA</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>A leaky garbage disposal can be repaired if you can locate the part that's leading to the problem.
