<p>No, you ought to NOT pour caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're severe about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be far more destructive than valuable, possibly eating away at your pipes.

<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
