Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
