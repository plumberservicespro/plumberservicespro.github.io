Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw.
