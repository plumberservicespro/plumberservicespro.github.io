At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction effect and draw prospective impurities into the safe and clean (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are commonly discovered in a lot of homes. Their components are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's needed.
