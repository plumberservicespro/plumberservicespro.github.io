Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the everyday costs and frustrations sustained by difficult water, a water softener is eventually an investment that will conserve you a substantial quantity of money. The cost of the water softener system is greatly exceeded by the cash and energy saved.</p>
<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation.
