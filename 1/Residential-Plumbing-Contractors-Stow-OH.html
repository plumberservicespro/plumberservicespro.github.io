When looking for a new flapper, your best choice is to attempt and discover the very same flapper that initially came with your existing flush valve. The easiest method to do that is by looking up your toilet model and picking the flapper recommended for that design. If you don't understand your design number, however, we do provide an extensive choice of "will fit" flappers to assist you out. See the video listed below for more information about the different sort of flappers readily available, or check out How To Replace Toilet Flappers for short tutorials on changing toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
