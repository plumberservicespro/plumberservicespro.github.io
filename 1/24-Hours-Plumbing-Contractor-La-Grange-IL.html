<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber La Grange IL</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the issue. You might have to look into using a high pressure water supply to remove the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. There are 2 standard piping materials used by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both provide numerous benefits and advantages such as removing the metal taste from your water.</p>
