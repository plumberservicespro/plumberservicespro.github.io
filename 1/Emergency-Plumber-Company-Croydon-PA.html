<p>Depending upon what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals described as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're truly correct, a sink waste disposal unit." Whatever you call it, changing one out or installing a new one is a relatively easy task. The work on private mains usually takes one to 2 weeks, and service work usually takes an extra one to 2 weeks, though some may be carried out simultaneously on a task. However, the gas to your house will just have to be switched off for a brief time period (normally less than four hours).</p>
<p>Utilize the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket.
