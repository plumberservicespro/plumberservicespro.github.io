PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which indicates plumbers can flex the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which saves time and money and decreases the risk of joint leaks. PEX also resists rust and freezing much better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending on your requirements.</p>
