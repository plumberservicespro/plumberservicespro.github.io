<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term hardness" came from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>

<p>Tank to Tank installation: Typically, changing a gas or electric water tank with a similar model takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old hot water heater. Placing the brand-new system takes roughly thirty minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to secure the brand-new connection points and confirm that all functions are up to code.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
