Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have actually been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide decades of defense. There are lots of local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature level, turbidity or quality can all trigger the assembly to deteriorate in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies may seldom need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>
