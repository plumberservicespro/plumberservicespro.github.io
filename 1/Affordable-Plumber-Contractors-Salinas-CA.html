<p>The most reliable way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange.

By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other discarding areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is managed through currently existing water facilities.</p>
