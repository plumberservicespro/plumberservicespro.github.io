<p>Proactive repairs can conserve you time and money in the future if you know that your gas lines are aging and might need repairs.

<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
