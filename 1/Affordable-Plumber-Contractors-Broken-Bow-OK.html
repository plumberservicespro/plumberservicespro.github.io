The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant factor to the solidity of Woodbury's water. Because it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes, firmness can appear as a nuisance when water is boiled or dried from a drip. It also hinders soap and detergent use.
