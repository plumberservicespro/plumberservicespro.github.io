<h3>When To Call A Plumber Farmington AR</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio home carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and parts. To prevent rust from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod secures the tank by drawing in destructive materials. By having the anode rod inspected regularly and changed as needed, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
