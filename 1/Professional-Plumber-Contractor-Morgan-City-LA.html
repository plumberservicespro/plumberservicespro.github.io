You, therefore, have to use more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized during regrowth. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
