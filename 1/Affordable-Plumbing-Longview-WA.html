As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that provides natural gas an odor typically associated with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinctive fragrance permits you to smell a possible leak. If you think a leak, constantly leave.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
