A toilet's tank is made up of several small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their frequent use. When these parts wear, they result in small leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
