<p>While battling a fire, firefighters are understandably more worried about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they utilize water from any available source to accomplish their objective, but fire department vehicles frequently bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>

Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
