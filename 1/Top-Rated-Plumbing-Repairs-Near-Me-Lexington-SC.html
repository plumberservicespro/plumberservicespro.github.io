<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific evaluations and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
