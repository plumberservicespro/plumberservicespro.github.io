<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
