<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet ought to be replaced. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
