<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it goes into the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
