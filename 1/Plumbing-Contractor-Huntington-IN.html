<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Huntington IN</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
