The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank.

<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
