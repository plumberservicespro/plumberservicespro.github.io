<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>
