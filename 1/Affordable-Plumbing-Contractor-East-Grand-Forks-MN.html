<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In East Grand Forks MN</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>If you are finding yourself flushing the toilet more than regular (and even more than when), this is a sign you may need a toilet repair or replacement.
