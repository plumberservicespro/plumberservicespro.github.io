<p>Examine Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers available that you might run into. The very first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Double Check although it may be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>
<h3>Gas Water Heater Repair in Bonita California</h2>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
