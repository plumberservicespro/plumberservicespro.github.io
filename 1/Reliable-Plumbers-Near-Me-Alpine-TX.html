<p>Rusting and rust on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a possible problem with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also imply the water heater is near the end of its life. With heavy corrosion buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it might mean that there have been changes in pressure causing little leaks.</p>

A PRV will manage water pressure as it comes into the home. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as components in the house will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>
<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically make use of an element that heats up water when the tap is switched on. The water is continuously warmed as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being warmed if the tap is immediately switched off. The heating temperature is typically pre-set to match your choices and requirements. Because they just heat water when needed, tankless electrical water heaters utilize less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
