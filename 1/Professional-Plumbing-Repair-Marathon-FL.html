Food washed down a drain unintentionally or on function without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing clogs and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles created by a garbage disposal wash directly down quickly.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
