<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>For example, if your hot water heater is continuously breaking down and needing repair, a brand-new system will save you money. In addition, if you notice increasing energy expenses from an inefficient system, you will also conserve cash with a brand-new installation. We suggest that all water heaters that are 10-15 years of ages be replaced in order to save the house owner money and time in the future.</p>
