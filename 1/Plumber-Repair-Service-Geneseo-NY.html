Which is why choosing a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is very essential. Nevertheless, you have to make sure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been specifically created to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight uniformly and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
