<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
