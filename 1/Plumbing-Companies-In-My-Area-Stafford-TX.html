The average cost of an aluminum garbage disposal varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel waste disposal unit has a typical cost of simply over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously challenging to trace, specifically on older properties, so you'll want to hire somebody who will trace the problem at its source.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
