<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of keeping the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you discover strange popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this might be an indication that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
