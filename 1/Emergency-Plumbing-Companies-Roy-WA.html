A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
