<p>In this situation, unclean water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to buy a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual flow, odor, taste or color.

<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the best length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place television back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To prevent this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation set consists of a tube, or buy one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>If you see wet locations in unanticipated parts of your house or discover a drop in water pressure, you may need to replace your plumbing pipes.
