<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Dumfries VA</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply eliminates hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>It's an excellent idea to weigh the pros and cons of this advanced choice if you're considering changing to a tankless water heater. While tankless water heaters are great in many aspects, they are not perfect for everybody. For instance, homes with a lot of family members or roommates, as well as those that need more than typical amounts of warm water daily, will probably benefit more from a traditional tank hot water heater.</p>
