As rust and minerals build up over time, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health danger in your water.</p>

Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
