<p>Agilent's range of leak detection solutions make sure the safety, security and constant performance of research study, vacuum, and commercial procedure systems. Examining the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and check if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this might be major issue if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main turned off valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in the house should have water. This goes for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working properly, you are off to an excellent start.</p>
