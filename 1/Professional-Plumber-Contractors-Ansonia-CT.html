It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
