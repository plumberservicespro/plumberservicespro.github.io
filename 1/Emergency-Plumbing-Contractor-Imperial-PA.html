Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to carry out site inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is needed as a result of a real or potential  cross-connection risk on a client's plumbing system.
