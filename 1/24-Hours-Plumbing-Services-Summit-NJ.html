<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
