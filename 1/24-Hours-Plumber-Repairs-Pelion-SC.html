<p>This type of valve is used on agricultural areas. It is meant to keep the local water supply clean in the presence of numerous farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. The use of these items is called chemigation. There are numerous elements to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which permits flow in only one direction. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last element is the injection port. This is where the chemicals are introduced to go downstream of the check valve.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
