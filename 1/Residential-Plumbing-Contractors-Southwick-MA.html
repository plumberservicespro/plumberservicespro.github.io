I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>
