<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
