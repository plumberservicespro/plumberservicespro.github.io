The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for locals. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist identify.</p>
