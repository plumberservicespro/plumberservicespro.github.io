<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less vital things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
