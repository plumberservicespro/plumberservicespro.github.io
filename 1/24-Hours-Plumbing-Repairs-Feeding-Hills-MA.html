<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a need more than a need.

Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
