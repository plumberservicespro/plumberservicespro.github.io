The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This little hole allows water to continually leak out extremely slowly. In time it can result in a significant build of water. Dripped water typically remains under your home and saturates into the ground soil. If the house's structure was not correctly compressed, this can possibly trigger a cavity.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
