Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
