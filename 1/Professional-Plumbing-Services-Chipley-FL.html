When searching for a brand-new flapper, your best option is to attempt and find the very same flapper that initially included your existing flush valve. The easiest method to do that is by looking up your toilet model and choosing the flapper recommended for that design. If you don't know your design number, however, we do provide a comprehensive choice of "will fit" flappers to assist you out.

<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to the City of Bellingham.
