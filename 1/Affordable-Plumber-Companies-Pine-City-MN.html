<p>Many property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their filthy or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and affordable, but they damage your pipes and their effects are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating vulnerable points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
