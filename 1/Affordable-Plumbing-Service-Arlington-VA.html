Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
