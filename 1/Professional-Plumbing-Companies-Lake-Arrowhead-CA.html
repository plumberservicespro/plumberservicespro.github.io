When it rains, any excess water is expected to decrease a storm drain in order to avoid flooding problems. If you are currently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a likelihood that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason requires to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a prompt manner, the possibilities are high that it will cause extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation.
