<p>On its own, gas is colorless and odorless. A lot of utility companies include a sulfur compound to gas, which is where the rotten egg odor comes from. That way, you can quickly inform if you have a gas leak.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to obstructions with food and grease being the major culprits. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can produce serious drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the problem for regular home plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your house, you need your drain cleaned up prior to it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
