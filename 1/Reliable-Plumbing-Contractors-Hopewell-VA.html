<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
