<p>One common method for a home's supply of water to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
