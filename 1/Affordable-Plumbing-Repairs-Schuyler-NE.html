Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly safeguarded.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when used in combating a fire. Firemen by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with securing individuals's lives and to a lower degree their home. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source readily available to accomplish that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as a result imply that the level of protection on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high danger security level.</p>

A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private residences, it likewise prevents wastewater in private homes from receding out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>
