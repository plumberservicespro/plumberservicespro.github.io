<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see however hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this accreditation. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
