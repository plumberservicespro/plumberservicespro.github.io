<p>A cross-connection is any short-lived or irreversible connection in between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls.

Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to repair the concern and find for normal home plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it causes additional damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
