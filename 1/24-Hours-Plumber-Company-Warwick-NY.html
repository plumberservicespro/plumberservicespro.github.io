<p>When utilized in combating a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firemen by and big are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about safeguarding people's lives and to a lesser level their home. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source offered to attain that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome suggest that the level of defense on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high danger defense level.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and situations that need backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is very important for owners to notify the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial residential or commercial property, the District examines making use of each brand-new tenant. The correction must be made prior to water service is permitted if the present backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the tenant or the property owner.</p>
