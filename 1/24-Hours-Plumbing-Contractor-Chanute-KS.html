These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
