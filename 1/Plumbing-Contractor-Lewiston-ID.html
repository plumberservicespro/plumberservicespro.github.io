<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Lewiston ID</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
