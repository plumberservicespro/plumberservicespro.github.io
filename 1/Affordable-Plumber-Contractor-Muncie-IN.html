Use an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
