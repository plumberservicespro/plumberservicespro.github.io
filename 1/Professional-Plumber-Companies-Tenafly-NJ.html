This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi).
