<p>Odd Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it most likely needs a comprehensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to travel through.

This causes the water to bubble, as only little pockets of air are available, resulting in the unusual sounds originating from your sink.</p>
