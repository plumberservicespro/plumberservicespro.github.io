<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
