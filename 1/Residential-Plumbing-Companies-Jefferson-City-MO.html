<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
