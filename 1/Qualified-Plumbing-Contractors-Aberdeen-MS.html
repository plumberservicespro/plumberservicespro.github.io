<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply.

Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
