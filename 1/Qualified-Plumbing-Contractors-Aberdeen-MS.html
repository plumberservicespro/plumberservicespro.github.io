<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
