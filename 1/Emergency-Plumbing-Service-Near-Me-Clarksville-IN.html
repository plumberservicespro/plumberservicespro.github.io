<p>Letters are sent out to residential consumers with recognized backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs.

Relying on the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
