<p>On normal installation. 3" vent. Offer not valid with previous charges or with any other offers or specials. Consumer must reveal offer at time of purchase. A few years ago, lots of people began transforming from oil to natural gas to sustain elements in their home. A gas line will work with lots of home devices, water heaters, ovens and stoves, and in some areas, they will supply the fuel that's used for heater in residential houses.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it immediately ends up being a serious safety danger.
