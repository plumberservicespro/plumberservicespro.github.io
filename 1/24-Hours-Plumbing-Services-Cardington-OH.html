<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>

<p>Check the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of four must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will imply that less water will be heated and available for use.
