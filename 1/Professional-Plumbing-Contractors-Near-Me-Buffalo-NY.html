<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>As soon as installed, these BPAs go through preliminary and periodic testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued functional effectiveness. Such testing should be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester registered with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also offered online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Information ).</p>
