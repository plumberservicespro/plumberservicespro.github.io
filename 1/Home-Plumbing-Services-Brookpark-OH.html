Our experts are here for you at any time and are offered for emergency employs order to guarantee you get the instant service you deserve. Provide us a call at 614-412-3951. It's so old that it is no longer able to press water through the toilet to completely clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a constant obstructing problem.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>It assists to know the brand name and model of your toilet. The trademark name is typically on the bowl behind the seat. Sometimes, the design or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an uncommon flapper can end up being a trial-and-error procedure. Even professional plumbers often attempt 2 or three flappers before they discover one that works well.</p>
