Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
