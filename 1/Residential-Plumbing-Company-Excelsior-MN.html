<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and obligation are incredibly important to building a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean supply of water within a building these gadgets are known as isolation" BFP.

The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no way to offer one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Damage control is a concern. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I face circumstances, quite often that need a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
