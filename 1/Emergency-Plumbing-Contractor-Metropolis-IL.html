<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside and underground, DCVs are a bit more pricey but are likewise highly hassle-free, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in finding buried septic systems or examining the condition of buried pipes to determine correct maintenance schedules or the level of necessary repairs.
