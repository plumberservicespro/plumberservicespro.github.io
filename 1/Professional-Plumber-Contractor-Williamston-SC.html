Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the day-to-day expenses and aggravations incurred by tough water, a water softener is eventually a financial investment that will conserve you a substantial amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is significantly surpassed by the cash and energy saved.</p>
