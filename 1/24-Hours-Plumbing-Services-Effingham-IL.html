<p>Before the repair technician begins the repair process, he should make sure he has evaluated the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to identify any limiting conditions. If the area is thought about a confined area, proper safety preventative measures should be followed for correct entry. A safe and correct work environment may entail the placement of security barricades or entry limitations around the work area so the repair professional or the general public around your work area are not damaged. This might impact the technician's ability to successfully complete the repair if the backflow preventer is set up in a limiting area.</p>

Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
