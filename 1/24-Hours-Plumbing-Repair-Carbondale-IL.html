The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
