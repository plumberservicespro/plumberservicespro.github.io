<p>No, you must NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be far more damaging than handy, potentially eating away at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's whole plumbing system, including both water system and drain lines. Normally, a whole-house repipe is worth the investment in the long run due to the fact that it may attend to the root cause of the chronic plumbing problems in your home.</p>
<p>When it comes to repairing a broken or stopping working sewer line, there are a few choices. The best choice for your house will depend on a couple of elements, including the age of your existing pipes, the degree of damage, and your spending plan. An approved backflow prevention device, which need to be evaluated every year, must be set up on the service connection that the department has recognized as having a capacity for backflow.</p>
