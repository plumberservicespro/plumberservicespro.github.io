Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water utilize schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
