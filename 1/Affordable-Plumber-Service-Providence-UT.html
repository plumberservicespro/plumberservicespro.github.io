<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>No other room in a house contains as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Prevention is much better than cure. You need to install a backflow device on your if you have a well or a watering system water system. Discolored water- Your water should always be crystal clear.

<p>Gas is tough to discover, as it's a colorless, odor-free substance. We use gas in our houses with gas heaters, stoves, and ovens.

<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
