<p>Each component of the assembly must be tested to determine what is in need of repair. The field test might not always show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the basic rubber repair kit are required.

<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner set and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
