Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>In some cases, a natural gas line might be covered if it is ruptured. If a contractor is working on a person's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line, this type of circumstance may happen.

Employing a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your primary step; a plumber can detect the problem and repair it.</p>
