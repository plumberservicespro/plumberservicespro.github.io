It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it also.</p>
