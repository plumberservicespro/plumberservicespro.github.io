<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This deterioration can cause a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Backpressure takes place when the pressure in a private water supply surpasses the pressure in the general public water distribution lines that can cause normal flow to reverse. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might cause this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, sink, floor and tub drains.</p>
