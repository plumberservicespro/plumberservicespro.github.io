<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will establish. Often the option is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to fix the issue. Other times a more comprehensive solution is required: repiping.</p>
