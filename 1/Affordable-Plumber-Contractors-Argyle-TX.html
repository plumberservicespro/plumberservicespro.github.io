<p>Another benefit is that tankless water heater repairs are a lot easier to perform. Many water tanks end up in the recycling bin since they're impossible to repair if the enamel liner cracks or if the unit establishes other internal problems.

<p>New shower drains produce strong seals that are less most likely to loosen up with time. Numerous alternatives are excellent for tight spaces and allow for fast installation. If you have a historical home, we can discover a drain that will look excellent with your existing d√©cor.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
