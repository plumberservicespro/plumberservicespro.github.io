If the motor spins easily, check that the breaker hasn't tripped and after that try the reset button. If these measures do not work, and your disposer's service warranty has expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>If your toilet is continuously running or won't perform at all, or if you need a complete replacement, we have actually got you covered. Possibly you're just sick of the darn thing and want a brand-new design set up.
