<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
