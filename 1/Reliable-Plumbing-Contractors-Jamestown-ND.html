<p>Surface Area Accelerated Condensation is a development that mimics biomineralization, the system typically recognized for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is attained with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to entirely get rid of short-lived hardness in water.</p>

Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of least expensive pressure.

The need upstream could cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
