<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals described as waste disposal unit," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually proper, a sink waste disposal system."

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
