<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to consider. An entirely various disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into location. A protected seal is a must. When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to link wires properly, and the base covered to protect the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Though it's not always needed, sometimes the plumber may need to upgrade or repair electrical wiring to power the brand-new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot light might need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. The flowers or plants near the gas leak will be discolored or degraded if the gas line is harmed. Contact our experts to figure out the extent of the problem.</p>
