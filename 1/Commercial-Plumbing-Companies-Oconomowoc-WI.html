<h3>Clogged Sewer Line in Oconomowoc Wisconsin</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
