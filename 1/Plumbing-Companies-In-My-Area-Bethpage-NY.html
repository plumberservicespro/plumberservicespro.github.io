<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Bethpage NY</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
