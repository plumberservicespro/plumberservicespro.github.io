<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
