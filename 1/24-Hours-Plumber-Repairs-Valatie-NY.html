As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
