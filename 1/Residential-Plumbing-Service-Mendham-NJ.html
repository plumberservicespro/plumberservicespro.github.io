<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.
