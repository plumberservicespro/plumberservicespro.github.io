<p>The water used to regenerate the softener beads ends up as waste.

<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
