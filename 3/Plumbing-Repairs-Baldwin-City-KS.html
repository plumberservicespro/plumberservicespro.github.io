Residences integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, let alone the health risks connected with lead.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
