<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
