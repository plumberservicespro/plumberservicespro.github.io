<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Before our professional technicians can begin using their abilities and experience, we initially need to ensure that the line is appropriately cleaned up and gotten ready for our repair. Our repair procedures rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to permit the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
