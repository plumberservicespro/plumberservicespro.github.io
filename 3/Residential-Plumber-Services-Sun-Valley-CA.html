<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white spots on your dishes that will not disappear, white shirts that turn gray and dull after a couple of washes, or a stubborn layer of soap residue in your shower, you'll be happy to know that water softening can remove these problems and more. Tough water causes these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to worry about any problems with mineral deposits staying. This makes chores simpler and less frustrating for everyone included.</p>
