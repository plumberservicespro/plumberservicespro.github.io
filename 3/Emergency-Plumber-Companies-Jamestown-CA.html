<p>Repiping your house with Super Plumbers is quickly, easy and cost efficient.

For the typical home that doesn't have major water concerns, the Aquakinetic Series is developed with two tanks to supply you with soft, clean water. These systems are non-electric and are essentially maintenance-free.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heaters - supply hot water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water triggers the heater and water is heated as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases should never ever be put down the garbage disposal because they can hinder the blades. Last but not least, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to ensure that all food particles have actually been washed through the pipes.</p>
<p>Keep your kitchen plumbing in leading shape with quality plumbing services from Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Cooling. Make certain to examine the service warranty for your existing sink or faucet. Some higher end brand names have generous guarantees that cover the mechanics and surface of the fixture. Contact the manufacturer to see whether your warranty covers a free replacement if you need to replace the sink or faucet.</p>
