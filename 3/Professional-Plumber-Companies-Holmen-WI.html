For home, it is important for owners to alert the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well.

Expenses of a water softener greatly rely on the type of water softener and the type of energy that is used, however also upon the firmness of the water that needs softening and the water use. When the water is extremely hard and it is used heavily, the costs of softening will increase.</p>
