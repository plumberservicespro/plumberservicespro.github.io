<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that threat, mercaptans are included into gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make sure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
