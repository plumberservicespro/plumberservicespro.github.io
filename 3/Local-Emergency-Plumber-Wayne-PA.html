<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
