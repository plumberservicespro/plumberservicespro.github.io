<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

Understanding if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be convenient when working out the sale of a house.

All gas piping setups need a permit and inspection.</p>
