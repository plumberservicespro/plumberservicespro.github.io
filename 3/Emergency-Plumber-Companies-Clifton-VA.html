<p>When used in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firemen by and large are not interested in backflow prevention concerns. They are interesting in safeguarding people's lives and to a lesser degree their home. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source readily available to achieve that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome suggest that the level of protection on the fire protection system might need to be increased to a high hazard security level.</p>
<p>A malfunctioning toilet is one household problem most of us would rather avoid. However, you can not disregard a toilet concern.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
