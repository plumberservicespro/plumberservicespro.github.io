<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair specialist knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can become used and rusty, leading to leakages. Depending on the severity of the scenario, only one piece might need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly needs to be eliminated and changed. Parts involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, need to be reconfigured.</p>
