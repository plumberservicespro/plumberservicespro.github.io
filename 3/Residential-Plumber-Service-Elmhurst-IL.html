<p>Depending upon your circumstance, your plumber might use one or a combination of piping material throughout your home repiping project. Copper is basic because it's lasting, can survive fires, and withstands weather condition. However, copper is tough to install, which suggests higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of versatility, which indicates plumbers can bend the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which conserves money and time and decreases the danger of joint leaks. PEX likewise withstands deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending on your needs.</p>
