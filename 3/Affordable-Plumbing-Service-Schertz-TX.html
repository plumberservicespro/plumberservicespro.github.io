<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
