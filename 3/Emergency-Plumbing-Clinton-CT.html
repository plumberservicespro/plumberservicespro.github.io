The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.

Although reasonably safe and very effective, consumers of gas must be aware of possible dangers to better secure their homes and families.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
