<p>The list of things a food disposer can take in is fairly short. Soft or crisp foods are great, however hard or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the typical kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring twist-ties and pads.

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
