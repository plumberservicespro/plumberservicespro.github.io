It is very important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an effectively operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to offer decades of protection. There are numerous regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature can all cause the assembly to degrade in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may rarely need repair while some are fixed on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
