<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Imperial MO</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had great reviews and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>You might have heard stories about a warm water heater exploding inside a house or business! It is very important to understand that a plugged temperature and pressure relief valve on your hot water heater can turn your hot water heater into an unsafe time bomb.

A standard tank hot water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before requiring a replacement, while a tankless water heater can last as much as 20 with appropriate maintenance and care. If your system is getting up there in age, it may be best for your long-term costs to replace it now.</p>
