<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
