<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.
