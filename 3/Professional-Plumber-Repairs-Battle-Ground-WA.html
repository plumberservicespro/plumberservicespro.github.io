<p>There are a number of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last forever. It has remained in place since your home was built so it is about the same age as your house. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your home.</p>
<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair service technician knows the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
