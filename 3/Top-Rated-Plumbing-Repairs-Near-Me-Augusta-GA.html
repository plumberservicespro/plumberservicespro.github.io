Copper is standard because it's lasting, can endure fires, and resists weather. Nevertheless, copper is difficult to install, which implies higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the advantage of flexibility, which means plumbers can bend the pipes removing the need for joints, which saves money and time and decreases the risk of joint leakages. PEX likewise withstands rust and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending upon your needs.</p>
<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
