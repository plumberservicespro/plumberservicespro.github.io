<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually maintained at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under the house is simply the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more.
