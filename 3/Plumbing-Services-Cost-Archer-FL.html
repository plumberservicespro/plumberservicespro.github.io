<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
