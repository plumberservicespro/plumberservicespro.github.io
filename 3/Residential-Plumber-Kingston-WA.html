<p>Depending upon your scenario, your plumber might utilize one or a mix of piping material during your home repiping task. Copper is basic since it's lasting, can endure fires, and withstands weather condition. However, copper is hard to install, which implies greater labor expenses. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of versatility, which implies plumbers can bend the pipes eliminating the need for joints, which conserves money and time and lowers the threat of joint leaks. PEX also withstands deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which material is best depending upon your needs.</p>
