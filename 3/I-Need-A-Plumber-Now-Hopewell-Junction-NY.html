<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
