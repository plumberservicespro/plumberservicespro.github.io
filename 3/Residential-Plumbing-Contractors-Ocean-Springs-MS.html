<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is utilized to reveal the strength of the acidity of an option. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating rust Co2 will potentially add to the development of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more destructive.
