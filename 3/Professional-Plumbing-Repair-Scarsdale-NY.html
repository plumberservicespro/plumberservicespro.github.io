<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and obligation are exceptionally crucial to building a reputation for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these devices are called seclusion" BFP. Once again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
