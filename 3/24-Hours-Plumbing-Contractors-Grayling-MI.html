<p>Bear in mind that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you ought to just work with a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs capture moisture so that it does not go into the control system. Although small pieces of sediment might survive a drip leg.</p>
