<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as promised. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be higher.</p>
<p>One common method for a home's water system to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem could spread exponentially. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in private houses, it also avoids wastewater in private houses from receding out and infecting the public water system.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly necessary, often the plumber may need to upgrade or repair wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an extra $50 to $100+. The pilot burner might need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is harmed, the flowers or plant life near the gas leak will be stained or weakened. Contact our specialists to identify the level of the issue.</p>
