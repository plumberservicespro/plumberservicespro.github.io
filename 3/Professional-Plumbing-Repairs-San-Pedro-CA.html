<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a stable and safe place.

You should wait up until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You need to also check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
