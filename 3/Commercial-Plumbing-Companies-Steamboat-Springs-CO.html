<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high danger security assembly.</p>
