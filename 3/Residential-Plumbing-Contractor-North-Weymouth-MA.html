Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>

Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper precautions if utilizing one of these products.</p>
