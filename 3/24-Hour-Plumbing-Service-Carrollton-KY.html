<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard task since of the age of your house and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
