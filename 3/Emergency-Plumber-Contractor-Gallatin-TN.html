<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably easy system, despite their importance.
