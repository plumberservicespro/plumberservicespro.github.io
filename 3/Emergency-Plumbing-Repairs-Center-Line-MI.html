Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange take place?

<p>A continuous-feed waste disposal unit is the most typical type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on.

At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
