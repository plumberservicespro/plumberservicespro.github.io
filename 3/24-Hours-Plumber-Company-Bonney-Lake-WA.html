Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
