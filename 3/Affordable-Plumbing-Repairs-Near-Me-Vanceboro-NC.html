<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
