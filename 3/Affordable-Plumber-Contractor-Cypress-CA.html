<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
