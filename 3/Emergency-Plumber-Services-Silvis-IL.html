The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.

When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
