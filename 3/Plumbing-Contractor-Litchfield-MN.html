<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you discover that your plumbing experiences numerous clogs, leakages, and water pressure variation that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you must speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service. Homeowners must check water pressure entering into their home on a routine basis. Water pressure should be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can can be found in at over 100 PSI.</p>
