<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
