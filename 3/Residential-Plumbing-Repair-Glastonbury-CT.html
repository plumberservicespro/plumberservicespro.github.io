<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical service, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
