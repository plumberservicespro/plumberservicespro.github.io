Rather than needing to put the waste into the garbage, where it might possibly end up in a garbage dump, garbage disposals let you grind the waste up into tiny particles that can be flushed to the sewage-disposal tank or sewer.</p>
<p>If it slowly drains away as you work, include more hot water. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to attempt a brand-new technique. Tankless units link straight to your plumbing and only heat the water as it is required. This results in savings on your energy bill.

<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be an indicator of a severe issue with your plumbing.

<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed effectively (Image 8). You do not need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>As the firmness in the water increases, so does the yearly savings. In a 40-gpg tough water market, salt cost savings alone can reach $1,144 per year.
