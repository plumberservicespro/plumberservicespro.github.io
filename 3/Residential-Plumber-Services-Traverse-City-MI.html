For example, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any real or prospective connection in between the general public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable pollutants or pollutants to go into the drinkable water system. Sickness can result from consuming water that has actually been infected due to backflow.</p>
