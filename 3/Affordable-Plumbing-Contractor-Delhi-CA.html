<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but rarely stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Traditional tank water heaters: These heaters utilize electrical energy and gas for fuel. They can heat up anywhere from 20 to 100 gallons of water at a time.

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
