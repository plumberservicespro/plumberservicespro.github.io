Picking a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is a good idea. The energy effectiveness of a storage hot water heater is suggested by its Energy Element (EF). The more effective the hot water heater the greater the EF ranking. However, just because a water heater has a greater EF value, it does not always mean it will have lower operating costs. You also have to think about the fuel source.</p>

Depending on the severity of the circumstance, just one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be removed and replaced.

Incorrectly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
