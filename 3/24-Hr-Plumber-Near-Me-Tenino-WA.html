<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
