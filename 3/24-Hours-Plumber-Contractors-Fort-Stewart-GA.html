As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and cracks. The liner is left to solidify in location for numerous hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. When the process is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
