<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
