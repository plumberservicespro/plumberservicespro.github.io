<p>In this circumstance, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to invest in a backflow valve if you notice your water has an unusual flow, color, taste or odor. A plumbing professional can identify whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature level or pressure might require replacing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to conduct website inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is required as a result of a actual or possible  cross-connection threat on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are only performed on Wednesdays.

<p>One typical method for a house's supply of water to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem could spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in private homes, it also avoids wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
