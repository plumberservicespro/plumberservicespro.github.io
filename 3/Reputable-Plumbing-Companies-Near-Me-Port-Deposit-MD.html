For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain.

If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.

He also did the job faster than original approximated, so the work was less costly than I expected. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
