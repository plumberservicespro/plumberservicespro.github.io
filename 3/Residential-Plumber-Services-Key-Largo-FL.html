<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions make sure the safety, security and constant performance of research, vacuum, and commercial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process includes covering Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leaks and corrosion within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the within the pipe and the material flowing through it. This repair technique is better for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of years, but steel eventually experiences rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
