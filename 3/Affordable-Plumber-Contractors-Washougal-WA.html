<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation.

To prevent this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation package includes a tube, or purchase one individually at the same time for about $3.</p>
