Tank hot water heater are the most common, and are kept up gas. Their style consists of an insulated tank where water is heated and kept until required. Gas hot water heater are more energy effective and operating expense are reduced by about half, compared to electrical hot water heater. Storage tank hot water heater have a greater initial cost than electric.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I have actually talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
