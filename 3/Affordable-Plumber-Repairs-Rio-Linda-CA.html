<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>You need to begin exploring your choices to recognize a brand-new water heater that best matches your needs if you find any of these indications.
