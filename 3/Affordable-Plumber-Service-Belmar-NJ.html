<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
