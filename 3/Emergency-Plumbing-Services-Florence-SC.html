<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
