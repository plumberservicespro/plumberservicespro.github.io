<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the pocketbook of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department need to satisfy or exceed the state requirements and carry the obligation for implementing them.</p>
