The exposure to carbon monoxide gas is so deadly that anyone who inhales it needs instant medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 individuals died from carbon monoxide poisoning between 1999 and 2010. To prevent this catastrophe, ensure to use your gas stoves precisely as instructed and never ever to utilize them to warm your house.
