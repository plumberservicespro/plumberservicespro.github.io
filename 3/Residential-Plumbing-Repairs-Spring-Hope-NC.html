<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Spring Hope NC</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.

A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.
