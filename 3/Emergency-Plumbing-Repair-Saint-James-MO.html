<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your sink, shower or tub. Gradually, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.

Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are among the most common signs that your system is at completion of its life expectancy, especially if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific person. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
