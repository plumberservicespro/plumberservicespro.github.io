<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures?

The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
