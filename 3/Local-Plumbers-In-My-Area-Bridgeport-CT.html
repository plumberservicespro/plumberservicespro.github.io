<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
