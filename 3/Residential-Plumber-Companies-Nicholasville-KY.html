Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
