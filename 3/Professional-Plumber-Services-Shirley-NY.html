Sediment Accumulation: If you observe unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this could be a sign that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Running out of hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a natural gas line might be covered if it is burst. If a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and unintentionally burst a line, this type of situation may take place.
