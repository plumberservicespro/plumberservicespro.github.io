Which is why picking a comfy, well-crafted toilet seat is incredibly important. However, you need to make certain your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been specifically designed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight uniformly and might eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
