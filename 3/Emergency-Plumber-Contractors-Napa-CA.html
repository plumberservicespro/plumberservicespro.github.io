Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low.

Therefore when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to speed up.
