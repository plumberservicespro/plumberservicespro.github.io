<p>Our Water Softeners Are Brilliantly Designed To Work. The majority of kitchen sink clogs are because of heavy grease buildup and food particles.

As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there must be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
