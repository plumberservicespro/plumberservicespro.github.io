<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Service in Pelham</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will establish. Often the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to solve the concern. Other times a more comprehensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I have actually talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
