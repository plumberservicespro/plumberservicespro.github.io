<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed throughout construction of a new or renovated structure is set up by knowledgeable artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is most likely in the draining fixture itself. Obstructions in a fixture can trigger harmful damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
<p>Clogged kitchen drains are among the most common household drain clogs people handle. Assist avoid frequent drain obstructions by having a garbage disposal set up in your kitchen!
