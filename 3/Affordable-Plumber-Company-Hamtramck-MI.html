<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize an option of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items containing extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Shortened to TAC, this approach uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where firmness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline form that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and flow generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regeneration.</p>
