Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or buying an older house.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your property.

The information we glean from the inspection enables us to make an informed choice relating to the condition of your pipes and advise the best solution also. We can make the perfect suggestion with confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
