<p>If you discover yourself constantly jerking the flush lever to try to stop your toilet from running, it's time to call in among our licensed Columbus plumbers to assist you in discovering the leak or broken component and fixing it.

Backflow can happen in a number of scenarios that might draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
