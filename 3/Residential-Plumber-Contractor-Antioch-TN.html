<p>The fuel line of your automobile materials gas from the fuel tank to the carburetor, making the combustion essential for the engine to run. You might have a gas leak from the fuel line if you smell a strong whiff of gas from your automobile when it is running. It is vital to repair this right away to avoid an explosion. If you are not specific of your repair abilities, it is best to take your vehicle to a certified mechanic.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would typically cause rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually become broken and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater extremely quickly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating supplies a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can cause significant problems and damage-- particularly typical in older homes. Utilizing a sewer camera to inspect the weak locations or clog, our extremely trained experts can rapidly find the source of the problem keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- efficiently carrying wastewater to your sewage-disposal tank or local system.</p>
