<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then return to service.

Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
