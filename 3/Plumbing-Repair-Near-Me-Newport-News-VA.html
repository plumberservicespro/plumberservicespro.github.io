<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Newport News VA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic style of a reduced pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an extremely low flow or static flow condition may trigger nuisance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly.
