<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>It's a good concept to arrange annual inspections if your plumbing system is decades old and if you know that you have a history of leaking or clogging. Test.
