<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent man. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
