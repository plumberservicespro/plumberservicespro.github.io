The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
