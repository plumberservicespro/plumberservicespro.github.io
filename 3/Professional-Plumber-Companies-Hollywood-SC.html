<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge.

When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated straight whenever it's required. When the tap is switched on, tankless systems specifically make usage of a component that heats up water.
