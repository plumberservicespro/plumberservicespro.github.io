Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
