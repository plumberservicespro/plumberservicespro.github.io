<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

We ensure the work is done properly each time. Most of our clients remain in Montgomery County, although we make toilet repairs in Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia, too.
