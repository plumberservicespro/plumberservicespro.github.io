<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
