<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
