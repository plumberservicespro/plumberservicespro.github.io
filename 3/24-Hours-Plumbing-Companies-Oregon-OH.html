When these parts wear out, they result in small leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
