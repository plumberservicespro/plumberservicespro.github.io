<h3>Laundry Box Repair in Ellabell Georgia</h2>
<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Typical enough that many individuals go for do-it-yourself repairs. But sometimes even recognizing the leak can be an issue. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain correctly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Often drain repair requirements can be resolved relatively quickly by a skilled handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be dismantled, examined, and cleared prior to being replaced. In many cases, a handyman might figure out that a replacement part is required (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to ensure typical operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to go over repair alternatives.</p>
