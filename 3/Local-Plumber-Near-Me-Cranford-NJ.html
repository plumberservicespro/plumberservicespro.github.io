The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
