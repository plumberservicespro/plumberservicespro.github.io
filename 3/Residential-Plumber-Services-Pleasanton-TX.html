<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Pleasanton TX</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very rare cases where the structure is deemed to not position a threat to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to schedule annual inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of clogging or leaking. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to evaluate the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the results to us. If you need a garbage disposal replacement, make sure to discover a plumber you trust who will get the job done right at a sensible cost.</p>
