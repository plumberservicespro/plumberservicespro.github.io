<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause corrosion that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Gradually, like any other home appliance in your house, your waste disposal unit. may require repairs. A disposal system may start or clog to leak through heavy, or improper, use.
