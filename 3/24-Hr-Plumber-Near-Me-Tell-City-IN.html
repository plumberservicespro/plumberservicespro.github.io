A hot water heater is essentially a household device that consists of a gas or electric heating system under a tank in which water is warmed and kept.

<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
