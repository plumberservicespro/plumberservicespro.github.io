If, say, you need a new burner set and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

Before utilizing a softener for this purpose, follow the suggestions listed in your home Water Treatment.</p>
