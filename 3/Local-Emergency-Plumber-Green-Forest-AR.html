<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
