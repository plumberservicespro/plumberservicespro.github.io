<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
