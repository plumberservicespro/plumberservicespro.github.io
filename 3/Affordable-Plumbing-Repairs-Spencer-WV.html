<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
