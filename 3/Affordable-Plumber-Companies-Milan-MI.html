Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
