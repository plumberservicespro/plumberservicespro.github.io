As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer.

<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
