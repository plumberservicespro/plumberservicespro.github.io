<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
