<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
