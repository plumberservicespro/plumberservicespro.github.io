<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractor in Milwaukee</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers available that you might run into. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check despite the fact that it might be marketed as one! Do not get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
