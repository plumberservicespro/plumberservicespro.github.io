<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank.

The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
