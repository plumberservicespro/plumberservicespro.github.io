<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you need to most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils.
