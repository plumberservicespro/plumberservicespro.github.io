Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Gradually, like any other home appliance in your home, your waste disposal unit. may require repairs. A disposal system might clog or begin to leak through heavy, or incorrect, use. A leak someplace in the system might indicate a used seal. In some cases, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the whole system. This is where the UPC actually comes into play.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
