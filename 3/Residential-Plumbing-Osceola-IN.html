<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>This is one of the main and very first concerns that you need to ask yourself when it comes to repiping and replacing plumbing in your home. The age of your house is a critical part to understand whether or not you ought to repipe your home.

If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you work with a plumbing professional to examine your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. Possibilities are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at ideal rates if your home was developed decades prior to that.</p>
