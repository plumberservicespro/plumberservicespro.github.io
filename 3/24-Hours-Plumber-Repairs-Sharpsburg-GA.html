Toilets conserve lives. It may sound crazy, however it's true. Proper sanitation in the form of functioning toilets and properly maintained sewer system helps avoid possibly deadly illness from assaulting you and your family. In the United States we are exceptionally fortunate that the majority of us never need to stress over catching such illnesses, however it is still essential to keep our toilets clean and in excellent operating condition to prevent the potential for disease to our families - in addition to saving ourselves the general trouble and high cost of toilet problems left unattended for too long.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
