<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.

In drinkable water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with destructive water contaminants.</p>
