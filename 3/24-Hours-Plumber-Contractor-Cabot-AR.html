<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to carry out site inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is needed as an outcome of a actual or potential  cross-connection hazard on a client's plumbing system.
