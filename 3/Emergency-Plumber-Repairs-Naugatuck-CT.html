Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Naugatuck CT</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
