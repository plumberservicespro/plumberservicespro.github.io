<p>A plumbing floor plan (plan view) or partial layout suggesting water services, name and address of center, water meter layout, proposed backflow preventer( s), booster pump system, floor drain( s) and all neighboring things (examples: electrical panels, boilers, chillers, storage tanks, fire pumps, fire sprinkler risers, etc.).

<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heaters - offer warm water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water triggers the heater and water is heated up as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal because they can hamper the blades. Last but not least, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to make sure that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
