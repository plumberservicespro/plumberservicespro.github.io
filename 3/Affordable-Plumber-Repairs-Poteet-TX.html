<p>The best method to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities site is by installing a pressure minimizing valve (PRV). A PRV will manage water pressure as it comes into the home. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can likewise help to conserve water as fixtures in the house will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Storage facility also carries a broad variety of backflow prevention accessories. These accessories include backflow prevention system accessories, backflow device enclosures, test kits, repair parts, and insulated pouches. However, if your hot water heater is over 10 years and is constantly having problems, a whole unit replacement is the more affordable choice. It will be much better to deal with a new, more efficient system than to spend on frequent repairs.</p>
