When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to travel through. Due to the fact that of the tight space, the pipes often make odd gurgling sounds as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the weird sounds emanating from your sink.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work.
