<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the potable system providing the makeup water. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential impurities can then go into the safe and clean water supply. The very best method to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
