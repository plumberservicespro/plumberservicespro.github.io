<p>If the water feels warm, then the heating element is taking longer to heat the water than it should. However this particular problem is when you have no hot water flowing in your house. The factors for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or defective electrical circuitry, or a broken heating element or thermostat. If it is one of the pointed out problems, a repair or replacement of the components might be adequate. However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems occurring frequently, then a water heater replacement is needed.</p>
