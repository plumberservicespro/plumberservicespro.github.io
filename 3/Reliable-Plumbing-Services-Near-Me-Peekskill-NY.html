<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>

The tank ultimately loses its ability to seal appropriately, creating waste and a greater water costs.</p>
