Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.
