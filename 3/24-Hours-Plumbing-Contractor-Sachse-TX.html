<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
