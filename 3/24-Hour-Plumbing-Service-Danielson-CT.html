<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they congeal to the piping walls.

Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the problem for typical house plumbing operations. If this is what is occurring to your home, you need your drain cleaned prior to it results in more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
