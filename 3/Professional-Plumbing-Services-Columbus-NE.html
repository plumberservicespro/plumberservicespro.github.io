<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roofing system vents or take out a toilet. This is usually more labor-intensive and may need extra costs. This is also not as efficient since the drain machine loses torque the even more you are far from the clog.

PEX and CPVC are both plastics and are outstanding alternatives to the pricey copper piping.</p>
