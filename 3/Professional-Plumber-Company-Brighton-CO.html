<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Brighton CO</h3>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case. You may need to check out using a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. There are two basic piping materials utilized by plumbing professionals. PEX and copper both use many benefits and advantages such as removing the metal taste from your water.</p>
