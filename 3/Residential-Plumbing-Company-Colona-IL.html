<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
