<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.

<p>A common whole-house repipe can take anywhere from three to five days, depending upon the size of the home, how many levels it has actually and the chosen pipe material.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted appropriately (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
