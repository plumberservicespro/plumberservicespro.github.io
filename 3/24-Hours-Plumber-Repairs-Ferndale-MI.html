<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.
