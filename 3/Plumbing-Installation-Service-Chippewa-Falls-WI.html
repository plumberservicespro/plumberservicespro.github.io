The plan needs to be drawn to scale or with dimensions indicated from walls and all nearby things.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it instantly becomes a severe security risk. Without being repaired as rapidly as possible, it might trigger a fair bit of damage if the gas inside ends up being sparked.
