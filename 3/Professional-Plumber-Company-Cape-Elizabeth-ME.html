Water conditioners are devices that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

When you attach the P-trap, likewise attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
