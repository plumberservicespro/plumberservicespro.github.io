<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
