<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
