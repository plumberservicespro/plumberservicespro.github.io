Much of us fall into a routine of preparing our lives around warm water without even recognizing it. Thankfully, the hybrid tank-tankless water heaters that we provide offer the best of both worlds.

<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by removing an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these aspects not only dry your skin and hair but also build up in devices and pipes decreasing their efficiency and life span. Your washing machine, water and dishwasher heater are all adversely impacted by hard water. The results of tough water can be seen on your meals, the color and softness of your clothes, the movie on your shower door and even your individual look and convenience.</p>
