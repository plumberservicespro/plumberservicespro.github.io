<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile.

Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are required to carry out website inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is required as a result of a prospective or actual cross-connection hazard on a client's plumbing system.
