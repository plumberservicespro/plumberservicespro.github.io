As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to ensure no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.
