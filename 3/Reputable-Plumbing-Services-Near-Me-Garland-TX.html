<p>American Plumbing Services, a Provo-based, full-service plumbing organisation, will install your waste disposal unit according to producer directions and offer you with details on its correct usage and maintenance. To the end user (customer), SpringWell Water (SpringWell") warrants that the following Covered items- retention tanks and mineral tanks (14" or bigger) will be free of any problems in product and craftsmanship for a duration of 10-years under regular application, service and use.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Quality sinks appropriately installed last for years, so we're generally employed for kitchen and bath remodels. But with discolorations or scratches in a kitchen sink as well as chipped or split porcelain in bathroom sinks many house owners select a sink installation alone. Sinks and fixtures may likewise develop drain problems that call for a sink repair. Bathroom sink repairs also include changing or changing the pop-up stopper assembly.</p>
