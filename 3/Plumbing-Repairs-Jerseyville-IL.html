<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right now. Before you can request an inspection, you need to initially acquire the needed authorization( s) for the work you intend to do. You can have a look at our License page for more details on getting an authorization. As soon as you obtain a permit you can commence with the work. However, you should require inspection prior to you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>If you have cracked or broken drains till a video inspection is performed, it's hard to figure out. Broken or broken drains are typically preceded by repeating obstructions, consistent foul drain odors or the presence of sewer flies.
