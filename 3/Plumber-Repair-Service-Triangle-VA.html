<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Services Around Triangle VA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
