<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>

<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than changing with a different design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
