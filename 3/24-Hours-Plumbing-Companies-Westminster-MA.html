Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
