<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working effectively because hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize a growing number of detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution.
