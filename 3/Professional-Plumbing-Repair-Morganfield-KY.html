<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than steady or direct) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
