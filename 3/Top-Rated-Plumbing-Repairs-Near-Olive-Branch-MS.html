<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
