<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for the majority of building and construction contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently eliminating firmness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>It's a strangely intricate clinical process, but simple to treat. It uses salt to remove odors and minerals found in tough water- most frequently calcium and magnesium.
