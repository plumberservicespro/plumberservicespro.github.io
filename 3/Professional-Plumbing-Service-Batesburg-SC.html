Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>You are well mindful of simply how major commercial plumbing issues can be if you own a business or handle a commercial structure.

You can also prevent serious commercial plumbing issues by scheduling services like commercial drain cleaning.</p>
