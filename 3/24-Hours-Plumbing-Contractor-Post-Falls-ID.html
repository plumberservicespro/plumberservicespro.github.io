<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Reduced to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline type that will not hold on to surface areas.

<p>You probably know one thing about your drains: they take water from your bath tubs, showers, and sinks to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working correctly that's actually all you need to know about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what type of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage.

<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be changed. If it is in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
