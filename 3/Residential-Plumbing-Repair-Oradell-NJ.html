<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the level of the rot.

Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
