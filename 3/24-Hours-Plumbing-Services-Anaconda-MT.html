<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of building contractors (or their staff members).

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.

Difficult water triggers these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to fret about any issues with mineral deposits staying. This makes tasks simpler and less frustrating for everyone included.</p>
