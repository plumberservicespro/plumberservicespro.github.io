<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is very important to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and clogs - think about composting or placing these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and gather in your drain too. After completing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and utilize for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and fast rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the system).

Not to discuss plumbing code may be breached without correct backflow prevention.</p>
