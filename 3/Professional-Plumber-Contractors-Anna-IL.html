<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth understanding about waste disposal unit installation.

Our personnel evaluates issues and plans permits for electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and building activities constant with the codes embraced by the State of North Carolina.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
