<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a problem. Firemen by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about securing people's lives and to a lower level their residential or commercial property. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source available to achieve that goal. This can develop cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome imply that the level of protection on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high threat defense level.</p>
