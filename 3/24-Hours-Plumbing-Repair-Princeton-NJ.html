<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the main water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
