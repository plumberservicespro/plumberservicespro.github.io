<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by getting rid of an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these elements not just dry your skin and hair but also build up in pipes and home appliances lowering their performance and life span. Your washing machine, dishwasher and water heater are all adversely impacted by difficult water. The results of difficult water can be seen on your meals, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your individual appearance and comfort.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction.
