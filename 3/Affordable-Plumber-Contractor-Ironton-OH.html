Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system.

Inappropriate installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to find.</p>
