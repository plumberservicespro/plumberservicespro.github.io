<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Company in Dover</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop. Often the service is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to fix the issue. Other times a more comprehensive solution is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
