When you hot water heater is not working appropriately, it may be due to the fact that of any number of repair or maintenance concerns.

<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

Some higher end brands have generous warranties that cover the mechanics and finish of the fixture. If you need to replace the sink or faucet, call the producer to see whether your guarantee covers a complimentary replacement.</p>
