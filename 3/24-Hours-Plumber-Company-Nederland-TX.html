<p>The program accomplishes its objective by offering the adoption and promulgation of ideal rules and policies for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to profit of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed effectively. A hot water heater that is not set up properly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Plumbers can fix toilets. A plumber will fix anything involving pipes and plumbing. It would be cost effective for you to attempt to fix your toilet first due to the fact that sometimes they are easy fixes. However if you've attempted and it's not working, call the plumber. What's in your water? A RainSoft test is the first step toward resolving your water woes. We'll send out a water treatment expert to your house to evaluate your faucet water, explain the results, and suggest the best solutions to satisfy your specific needs.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
