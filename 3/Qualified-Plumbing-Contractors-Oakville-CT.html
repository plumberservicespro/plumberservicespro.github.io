<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of building and construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of firmness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
