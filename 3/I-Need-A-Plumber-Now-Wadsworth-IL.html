<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
