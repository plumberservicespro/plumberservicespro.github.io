<p>E.R. Services understands the value of maintaining the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating aspect. Lacking hot water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
