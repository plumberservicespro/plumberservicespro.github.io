<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
