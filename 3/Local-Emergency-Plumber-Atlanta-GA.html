<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Atlanta GA 30349</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
