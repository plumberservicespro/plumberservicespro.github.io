<h3>Install Water Heater in Clarence New York</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
