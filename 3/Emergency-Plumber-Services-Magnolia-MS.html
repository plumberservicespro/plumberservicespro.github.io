<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
