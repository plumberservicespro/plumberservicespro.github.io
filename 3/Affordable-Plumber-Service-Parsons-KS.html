Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
