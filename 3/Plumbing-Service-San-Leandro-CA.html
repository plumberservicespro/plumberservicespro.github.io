<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI.

The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
