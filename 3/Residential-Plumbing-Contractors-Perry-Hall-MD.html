<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a couple of things worth understanding about waste disposal unit installation.

Leaks can be unhygienic and will also ultimately cause pressure on other parts of your garbage disposal if you believe about what you put down the disposal. The kitchen sink drain might need a simple tightening up or a replacement. You will see the apparent spray if the leak is in the pressurized hose spray.
