<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
