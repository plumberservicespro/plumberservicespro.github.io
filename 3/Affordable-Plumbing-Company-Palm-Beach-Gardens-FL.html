Repiping is the procedure of replacing old corroded pipes with durable and lasting new pipes. Because of their resilience and other factors, the new pipes that are used are normally made of copper. Repiping is mainly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
