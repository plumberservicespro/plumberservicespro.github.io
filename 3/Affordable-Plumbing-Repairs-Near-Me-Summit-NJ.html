<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
