<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
