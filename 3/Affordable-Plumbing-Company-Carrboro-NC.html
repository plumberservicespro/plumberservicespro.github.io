Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
