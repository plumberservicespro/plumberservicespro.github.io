<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
