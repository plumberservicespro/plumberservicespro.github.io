<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to guarantee that all plumbing set up throughout construction of a new or remodelled building is set up by well-informed artisans in accordance with relevant codes.

Blockages in a fixture can trigger detrimental damage to your draining pipes system the longer they continue.</p>
