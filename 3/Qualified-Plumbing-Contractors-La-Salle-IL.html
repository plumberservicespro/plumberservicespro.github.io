The pipe lining procedure involves our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pressed through your pipeline when the felt liner is entirely filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and imperfections. If heat is used, the liner is left to solidify in location for numerous hours or 60 minutes.
