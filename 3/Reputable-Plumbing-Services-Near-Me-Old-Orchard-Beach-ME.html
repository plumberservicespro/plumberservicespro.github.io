<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
