Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
