This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel eventually struggles with deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
