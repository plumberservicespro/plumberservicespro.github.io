<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>

<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water travelling through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
