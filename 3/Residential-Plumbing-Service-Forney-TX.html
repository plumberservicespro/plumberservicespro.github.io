<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>

This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>

However, if the water heater is beyond repair it may be time to think about installing a new system.</p>
