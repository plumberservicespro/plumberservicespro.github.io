These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
