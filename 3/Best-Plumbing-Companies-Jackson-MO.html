<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the perpetrator. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. There's a great opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. You might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
