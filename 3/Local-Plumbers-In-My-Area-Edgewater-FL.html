Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
