Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.

The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
