<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the system in a safe and stable  location.

If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you must wait up until after the cycle is completed and after that examined the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should likewise inspect to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
