It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage should also be provided.</p>
