<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
