<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
