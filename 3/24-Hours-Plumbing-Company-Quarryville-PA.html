When your drains are clogged, you will probably start to discover gurgling sounds, water supporting into your sink or shower, or strange smells. Drain clogs are brought on by wear and tear or a build-up of things we put down the drain with time and as we understand, they can trigger major plumbing problems.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
