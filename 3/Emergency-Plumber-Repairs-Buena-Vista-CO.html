<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day usage should not trigger a water softener to leak.

If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait up until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You should likewise check to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
