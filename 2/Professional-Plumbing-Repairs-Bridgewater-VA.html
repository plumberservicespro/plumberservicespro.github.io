<p>Typically triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Additionally, sometimes a faulty fill valve might actuate periodically, as well.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
