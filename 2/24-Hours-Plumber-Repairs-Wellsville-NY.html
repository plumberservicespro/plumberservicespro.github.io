The pros at Perez Plumbing have the devices, experience and knowledge to rapidly handle any plumbing issue you may have.

<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the accumulation might still take place.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>We've put together this comparison of storage water heaters vs. tankless water heaters to help contractors and property owners pick the type of hot water heater that's best for you. We'll examine the pros and cons of conventional and tankless units so you can make an informed decision. Tankless to Tankless Installation: This usually takes in between one to three hours.</p>
