Heating water represent as much as 20 percent of the typical house's energy spending plan. Some gas-fired tankless hot water heater declare to cut energy costs by as much as half.

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
