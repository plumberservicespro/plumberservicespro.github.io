<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Aransas Pass TX</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had excellent reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>When jiggling the handle doesn't suffice, it's time to call Apollo for toilet repair or replacement. We will install brand-new toilets and replace existing toilets.
