<p>It is estimated that the average individual invests over 3 years of their life sitting on the toilet, and many bathroom readers are at danger of ending up being permanently connected to the fixture. Which is why selecting a comfy, well-made toilet seat is exceptionally important. However, you have to make certain your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - implying a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively formed bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been specifically developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not distribute your weight uniformly and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
