<p>If you have actually constantly resided in an area with difficult water, you may not understand just how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Tough water interferes with the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
