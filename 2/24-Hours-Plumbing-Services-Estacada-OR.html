Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.

I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
