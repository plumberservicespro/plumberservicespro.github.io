You 'd be hard-pressed to find a homeowner grumble about the reality that they have a waste disposal unit, and many don't know what to do if they move into a house that does not have one.

However, they can end up being headaches if they are installed improperly.</p>
<p>Purchasing a house is a huge financial investment.
