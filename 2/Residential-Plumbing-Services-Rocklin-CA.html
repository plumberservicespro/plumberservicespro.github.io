<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would typically trigger rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately end up being worn and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater very rapidly, not to point out finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
