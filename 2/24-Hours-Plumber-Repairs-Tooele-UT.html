In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>

<h3>Leaking Pipe Repair in Tooele Utah</h2>
<p>Another common misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is an efficient kind of corrosion control. There is an absence of scientific evidence supporting this claim, however.

When hard-water scale is already present, Corrosion can still take place under conditions that are favorable to the formation of hard-water scale or even.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
