Water pressure might fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
