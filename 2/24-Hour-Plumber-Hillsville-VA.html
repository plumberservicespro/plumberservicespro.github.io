<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regrow after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
