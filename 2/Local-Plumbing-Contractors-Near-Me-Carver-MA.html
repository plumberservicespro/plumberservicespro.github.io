<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Contractor in Carver</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned service, stability and responsibility are extremely crucial to developing a track record for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean supply of water within a building these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
