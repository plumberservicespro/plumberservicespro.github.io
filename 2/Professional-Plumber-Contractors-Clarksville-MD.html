<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
