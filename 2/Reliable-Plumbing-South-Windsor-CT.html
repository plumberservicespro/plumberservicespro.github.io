<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are seriously damaged, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
<p>Broken pipes become exceptionally more expensive to fix as the rate of the circulation of the broken pipe grows.
