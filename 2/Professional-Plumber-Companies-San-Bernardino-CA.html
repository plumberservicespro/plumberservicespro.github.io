Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to discover.</p>
