<h3>Drain Clearing in Easthampton Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public supply of water and private on-site water supply and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections between safe and clean (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods supply an increased level of protection for the general public water supply system.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of piping that are utilized in the repiping process. Since of their security, cost and effectiveness, copper piping and PEX piping are utilized. Copper piping avoids bacteria from growing inside of the pipe providing healthy drinking water. PEX piping is made from a plastic material that is both light-weight and versatile. This material is resistant versus deterioration and will help improve water pressure.</p>
