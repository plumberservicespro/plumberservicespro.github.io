<p>No hot water-- The absence of hot water is the most significant indication that there is something wrong with your San Antonio water heater.

If your hot water heater isn't doing its only task, it's time to speak with the professionals.</p>

<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner package and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>These problems can be taken care of except for fractures in the body or interior lining of the disposal. You will need to install a new garbage disposal if this is your problem. You should repipe your home immediately if your house has lead pipes. These pipes might be harmful to your health by allowing lead to permeate into your water supply. No water filter you buy can definitively get rid of lead from your drinking water.</p>
