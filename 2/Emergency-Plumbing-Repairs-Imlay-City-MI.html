<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is a creation that mimics biomineralization, the mechanism commonly recognized for structured growth in the environment, including seashells.

The beads accelerate the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to totally remove short-term firmness in water.</p>
<p>When utilized in combating a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firemen by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about safeguarding individuals's lives and to a lesser degree their property.
