The salt water tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge.

When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
