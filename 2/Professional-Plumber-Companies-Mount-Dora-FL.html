<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Mount Dora FL</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
