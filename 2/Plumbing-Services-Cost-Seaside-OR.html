<p>Some pipe materials are more affordable than others; some are more susceptible and fragile to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure.

Nevertheless, to prevent off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
