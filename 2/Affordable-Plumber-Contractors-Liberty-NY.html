It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
