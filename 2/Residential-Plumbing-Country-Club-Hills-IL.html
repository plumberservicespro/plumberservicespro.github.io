<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for changing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic product that will be resistant to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
