<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
