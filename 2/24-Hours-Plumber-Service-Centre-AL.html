Strap the water heater to the wall with special straps (Fig if you live in an earthquake-prone area. A; available at plumbing shops and house centers). If they're needed, your plumbing inspector will tell you.</p>
<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can in some cases establish on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink. If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will leak into the cabinet underneath. A reduced pressure backflow preventer is the top of the line when it concerns backflow preventers, and is the device of option due to the fact that it can endure the introduction of fertilizer or other chemicals, it's also a sensible option for residential water supply.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can attempt dumping a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and after that turn on the waste disposal unit while running water.
