<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really important part of the style of each part. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused service of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge.

When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
