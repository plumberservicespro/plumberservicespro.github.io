<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
