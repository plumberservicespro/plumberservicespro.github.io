<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively simple system, in spite of their importance. The majority of commercial usage backflow prevention setups make use of a valve system that gets in touch with the irrigation line within your business, where watering satisfies the main supply of water. From here, the preventer can monitor the motion of water within your system, and prevent any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be caused by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Bowdon GA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
