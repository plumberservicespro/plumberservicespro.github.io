<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>Below the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and mounting ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the snap ring by pulling it open and snapping into place.
