<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
