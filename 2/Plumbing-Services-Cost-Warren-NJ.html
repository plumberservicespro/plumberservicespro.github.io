Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles. Place it back into the drain until you strike resistance once again, then turn the deal with backward and forward to work a few of the clog totally free.

He also did the job faster than original estimated, so the work was more economical than I expected. I will use Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
