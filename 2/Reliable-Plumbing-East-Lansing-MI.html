<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
