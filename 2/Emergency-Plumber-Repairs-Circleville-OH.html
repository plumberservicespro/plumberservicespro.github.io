<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when used in battling a fire. Firefighters by and large are not worried about backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will utilize water from any source offered to accomplish that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome indicate that the level of security on the fire defense system may need to be increased to a high risk security level.</p>
