<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractors in Oxford</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust.

The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
