<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and complex plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
