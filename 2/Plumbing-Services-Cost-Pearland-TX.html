<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Pearland TX</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
