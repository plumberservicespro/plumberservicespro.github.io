<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the property, allowing it to stream backward into city water materials.</p>
