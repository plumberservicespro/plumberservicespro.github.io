<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable alternative to do simply that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be an option.</p>
