<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
