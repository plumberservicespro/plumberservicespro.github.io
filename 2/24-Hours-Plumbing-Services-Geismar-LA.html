Examining the water meter is a fantastic next step in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. There is a leak somewhere and this might be severe issue if it is. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your house need to have water. This chooses every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to an excellent start if whatever is working correctly.</p>
