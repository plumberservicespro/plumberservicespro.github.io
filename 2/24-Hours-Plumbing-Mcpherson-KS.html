<p>Aside from these two crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.
