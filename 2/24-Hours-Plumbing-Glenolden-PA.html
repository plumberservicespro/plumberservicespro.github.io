<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
