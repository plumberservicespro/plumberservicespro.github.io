Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
