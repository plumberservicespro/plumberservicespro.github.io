<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
