Often manages are toilet parts that get corroded or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down correctly. It's an easy repair, but there's a trick to getting the flush handle out. The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the delegated loosen (Image 1).

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
