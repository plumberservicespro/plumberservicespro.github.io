<p>Many house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their dirty or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are easy to use and low-cost, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are only short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe developing weak spots that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>
<p>Though it's not always essential, sometimes the plumber may have to upgrade or repair circuitry to power the new garbage disposal. This usually costs an additional $50 to $100+.
