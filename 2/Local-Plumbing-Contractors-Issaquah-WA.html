<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation.

<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there ought to be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Form Development: Mold development is another unfortunate side effect if you need a sewer line fixed. This is most common when you also have an odor of sewage along with it. The mold growth would most likely be behind your walls but will begin to seep through with time. You will most likely see a white residue on your wall close to an area where a sewer pipe is located.</p>

Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp port and remove wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
