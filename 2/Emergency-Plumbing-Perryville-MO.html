<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid generally will assist eliminate them if you have rust spots. If you would like to try the gentlest technique possibly attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not suffice then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to check out the directions and security cautions initially!).

A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Tough water stops washing detergents and cosmetic cleansers from working as effectively. When washing items are used in tough water - difficult water ions bond with surfactants making them not available to bond with water.
