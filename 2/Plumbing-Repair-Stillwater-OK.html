<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Stillwater OK</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
