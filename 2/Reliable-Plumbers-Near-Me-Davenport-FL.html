Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
