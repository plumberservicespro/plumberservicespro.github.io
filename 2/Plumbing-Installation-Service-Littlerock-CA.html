<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and complex plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank.
