<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Everybody who's set up a couple of disposals is aware of this mistake: Forgetting to remove the dishwasher knockout before hanging the system. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you have actually replaced the flapper, the problem might be bigger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its capability to seal properly, creating waste and a higher water bill.</p>
