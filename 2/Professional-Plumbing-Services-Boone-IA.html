While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
