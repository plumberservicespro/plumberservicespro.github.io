<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an important part in a sophisticated system that has actually been designed and engineered to take all of the floodwaters and run off from rainstorms and channel it securely into the cities drainage systems.
