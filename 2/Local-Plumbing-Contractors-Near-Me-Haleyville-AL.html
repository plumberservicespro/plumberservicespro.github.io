He noted that there are certain contaminants that homeowners are handling and an RO can assist alleviate those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be fixed with the right RO system.</p>
