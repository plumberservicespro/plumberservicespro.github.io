<p>There are a variety of things that can fail with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line won't last permanently. It has been in place because your house was developed so it is about the exact same age as your home. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and deterioration. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that chance.
