<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the style of each element. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
