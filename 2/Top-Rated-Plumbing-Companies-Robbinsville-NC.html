<h3>Four Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Robbinsville NC 28771</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
