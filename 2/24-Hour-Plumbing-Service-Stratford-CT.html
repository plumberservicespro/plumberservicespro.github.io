<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
