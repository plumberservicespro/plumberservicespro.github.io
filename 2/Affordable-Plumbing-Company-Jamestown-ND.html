<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

<p>Galvanized steel drinkable supply of water and circulation pipes are frequently discovered with small pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom used today for new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically known merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and hard to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in common use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications.

<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working effectively because hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize increasingly more detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
