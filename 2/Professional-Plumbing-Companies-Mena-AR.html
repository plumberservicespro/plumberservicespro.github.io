<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Mena AR</h3>
<p>Broken sewer pipes can be more than just a costly repair-- they can result in costly and comprehensive property damage and lead to serious health dangers. When a sewer line fails, sewer line repair is the very first line of defense. Sewer line replacement is the just other alternative if the sewer line can't be fixed. Fortunately, Mr. Rooter Â® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
