<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
