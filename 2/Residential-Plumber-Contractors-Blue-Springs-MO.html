<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up during building and construction of a brand-new or remodelled building is set up by experienced artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Clogs in a component can trigger detrimental damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to perform site inspections to figure out if a backflow prevention device is needed as a result of a actual or possible  cross-connection threat on a client's plumbing system.
