<p>Did you understand that your kitchen sink is among the most used items in your home? Washing dishes is just the start. Stop and think about that for a moment. Child baths, family pet baths, watering plants, food preparation, prep for amusing, hand washing delicate products, and mopping just to name a few tasks. Repetitive use may indicate you experience problems.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Requirement for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out annual forward flow tests are sometimes perceived as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
