<p>A Kinetico water softener will provide your household with abundant, clean, safe water as needed. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more traditional technique, Kinetico covers all your options. Others bring bags of rocks for putting in the house traps or cleanouts so they are guaranteed future blockages in the line.

Since the drain machine loses torque the even more you are away from the blockage, this is likewise not as reliable.
