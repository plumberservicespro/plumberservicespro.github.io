<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to offer years of defense. There are lots of local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water temperature level, turbidity or quality can all cause the assembly to degrade in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
