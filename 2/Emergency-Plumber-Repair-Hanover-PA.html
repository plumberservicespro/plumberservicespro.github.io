<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
