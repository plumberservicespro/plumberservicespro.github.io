<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
