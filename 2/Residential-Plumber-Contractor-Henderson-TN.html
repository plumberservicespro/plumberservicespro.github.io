<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>

Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
