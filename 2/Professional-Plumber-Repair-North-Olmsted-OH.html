<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the unit in a stable and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also check to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
