<p>E.R. Services understands the significance of preserving the stability and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange happen? There is another essential aspect required to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the product. To keep your health, safety, and house comfort, we use only the best piping: polyethylene. Many homes and companies utilize galvanized pipes for water flow, which tend to deteriorate and can negatively impact our health. Copper is also frequently utilized because of its longevity and safer building and construction, however polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the market and makes sure the healthiest and cleanest water flow.</p>

While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
