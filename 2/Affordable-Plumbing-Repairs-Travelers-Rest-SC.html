<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly.
