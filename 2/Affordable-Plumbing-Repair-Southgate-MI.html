<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
