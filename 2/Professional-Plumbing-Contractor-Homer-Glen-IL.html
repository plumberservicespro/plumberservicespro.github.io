<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
