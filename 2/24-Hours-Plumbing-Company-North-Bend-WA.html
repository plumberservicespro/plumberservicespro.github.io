<p>The program achieves its objective by offering the adoption and promulgation of appropriate rules and guidelines for the construction of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed effectively. A hot water heater that is not installed correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
