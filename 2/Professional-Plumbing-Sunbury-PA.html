Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan designed to prevent the turnaround of the circulation of water. The 2 types of pipes that we choose to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 really different products, but they both have extraordinary resilience and longevity.</p>
