<p>It generally signifies rust and mineral buildup if you observe low water pressure or discolored water. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure. The discoloration occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it hazardous to consume.</p>
