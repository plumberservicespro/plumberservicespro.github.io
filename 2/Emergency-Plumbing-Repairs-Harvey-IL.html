<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as hot water heater.

Methane is a naturally taking place gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is likewise in some cases formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer.
