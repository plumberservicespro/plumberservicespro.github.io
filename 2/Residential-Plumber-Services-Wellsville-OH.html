<p>The program achieves its objective by attending to the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and guidelines for the construction of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed effectively. A water heater that is not set up properly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, and even a fire.

High water pressure results in leaks, running toilets and other plumbing problems that will continue to happen without proper pressure reduction.

<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese.

Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
