<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
