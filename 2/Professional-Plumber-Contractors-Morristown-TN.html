<p>Numerous property owners think their energy companies or property owners insurance is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the truth is that in many cases you, the homeowner, are responsible. Most basic homeowners insurance plan and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your house.</p>
<p>The White Glove Health & Security Plumbing Inspection covers over 100 products in the common house plumbing system. It is a FREE service with an Abacus Club Membership (a $200 worth). You don't have to do a thing! We'll remind you when it's time for your yearly plumbing inspection. There is no much easier way to keep your home's plumbing system running at peak efficiency.</p>
<p>For example, if your hot water heater is continuously breaking down and needing repair, a new unit will conserve you cash. Furthermore, if you see increasing energy costs from an inefficient system, you will also conserve cash with a new installation. We recommend that all hot water heater that are 10-15 years old be replaced in order to conserve the homeowner time and money in the future.</p>
<p>It is necessary that all aspects of your gas lines are in excellent condition. The state of the pipe is important. As is the connection to your device and equipment. If any of these are a problem, there is the capacity for gas leakages and even fire. When a Notification of Correction" or Notification of Requirement" is provided, failure to fix an installation or install and then evaluate a backflow assembly may lead to service disturbance or termination.</p>
