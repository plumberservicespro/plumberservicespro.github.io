<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
