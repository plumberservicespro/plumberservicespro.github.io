<p>The pipe-bursting technique is utilized on pipes that are significantly harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.
