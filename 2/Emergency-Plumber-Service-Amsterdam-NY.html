<p>As a locally-owned business, stability and duty are extremely crucial to developing a credibility for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable water system within a structure these devices are called isolation" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air space, if there is no way to provide one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. If a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and mistakenly rupture a line, this type of situation may take place.
