<p>Galvanized steel drinkable water system and circulation pipes are commonly found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom utilized today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically known merely as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and tough to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building regulations non-combustibility requirements typically discovered in hotels, apartment and other commercial applications. It is also extremely long lasting and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most commonly used pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water utilize schedule, such models are practical.</p>
