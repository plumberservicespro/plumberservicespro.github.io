<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Norwalk IA 50211</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than products containing extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a garbage disposal is just geared up to manage softer organic waste. If bones or other difficult foods get stuck in the disposal, it might trigger it to jam and not work properly. By running hot water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. Nevertheless you run the risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
