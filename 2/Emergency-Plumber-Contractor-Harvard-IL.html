<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. A lot of folks replace their water heaters due to bad performance, complete failure or as a preventive procedure. If your hot water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to think of changing it with a more efficient design. Water on the floor can suggest used parts. Your plumber might replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole.

<p>An electrical inspection offers inspection services for all commercial and commercial buildings, and validates compliance with the electrical code.
