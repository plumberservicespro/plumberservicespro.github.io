Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly.

<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By setting up a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other discarding areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
