<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
