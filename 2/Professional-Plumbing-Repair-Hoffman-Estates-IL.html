<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your water heater installation consultation. Installing gas lines can bring a new level of service. As tough water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside draw in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause tough water stay with the beads, and the cured water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
