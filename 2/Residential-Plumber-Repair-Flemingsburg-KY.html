<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Flemingsburg KY 41041 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
