<p>A second part of the Battelle Research study compared cleaning agent dosage, water hardness, and washing temperature to see if solidity had an effect on cleaning agent savings. The study consisted of tests that got rid of tough soils, in addition to examining filming and spotting. Researchers discovered that softened water uses practically 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent savings increases to nearly 70%.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Protection Systems for performing yearly forward flow tests are in some cases perceived as a required to have them.
