<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractor in Williamstown</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers readily available that you may run into. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Double Check even though it might be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI.
