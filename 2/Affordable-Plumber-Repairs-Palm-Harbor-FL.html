<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a significant plumbing repair, and you must just employ a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the job is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For numerous installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.
