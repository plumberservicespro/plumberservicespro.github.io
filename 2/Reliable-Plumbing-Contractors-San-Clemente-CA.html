<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
