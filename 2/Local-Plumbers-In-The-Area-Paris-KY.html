<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Backflow Preventers are a crucial component of any plumbing project with the function of keeping potable water separate from any prospective dangers through various applications. We provide a range of kinds of Backflow Preventers, including Lowered Pressure Zone (RPZ) Assemblies, Vacuum Breakers, Dual Checks, and Double Check Valve Assemblies, along with accompanying test valves, enclosures, and packages.</p>
