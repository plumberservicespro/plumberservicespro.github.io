It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
<p>Once set up, these BPAs go through routine and initial testing and maintenance requirements to confirm their continued operational efficiency.
