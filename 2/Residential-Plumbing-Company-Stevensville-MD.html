<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the easiest of the three readily available techniques. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need less repairs in time. Sanford & Child plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

It is NOT the same thing as a Double Check even though it may be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI.
