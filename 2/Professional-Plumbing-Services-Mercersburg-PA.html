<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently since hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, have to use more and more cleaning agent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
