<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than items consisting of severe chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out annual forward circulation tests are in some cases perceived as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to just connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
