<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Mayo FL</h3>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
