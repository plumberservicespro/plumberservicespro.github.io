<p>On its own, natural gas is colorless and odorless. Most utility companies add a sulfur compound to natural gas, which is where the rotten egg smell comes from. That method, you can easily inform if you have a gas leak.

Leaking sewer lines inside your home can damage floorings, woodworking, and other valuable things such as cabinets.

<p>The Plumbing Inspection Division is accountable for protecting the water supply by guaranteeing, through strategy review and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
