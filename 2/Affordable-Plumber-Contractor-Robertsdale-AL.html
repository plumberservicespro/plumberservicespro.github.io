<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Robertsdale AL</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the issue if this is the case.

<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow.
