<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>

<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that certain magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be reliable in preventing scale development in tough water systems. It is extremely hard to judge such claims, which are nearly never based on tests that are well enough described to enable others to assess them and to confirm the results.
