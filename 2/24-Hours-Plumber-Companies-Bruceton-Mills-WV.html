<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there ought to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you need to probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils.
