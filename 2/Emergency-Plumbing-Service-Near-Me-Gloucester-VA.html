Selecting a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is recommended. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is indicated by its Energy Aspect (EF).

<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
