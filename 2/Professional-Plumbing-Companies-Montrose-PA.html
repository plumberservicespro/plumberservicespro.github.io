<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. It usually shows wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up when this occurs.

For a leak in the drain pipe, you may have to fill the sink with water prior to analyzing the pipe underneath.</p>
