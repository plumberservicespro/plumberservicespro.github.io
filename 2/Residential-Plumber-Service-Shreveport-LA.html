<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house. Even if the problem stems with the municipal system, it's still wise to bring in the specialists to restrict the damage to your home.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
