<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids pollutants or contaminants from being drawn into the drinking water supply.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
