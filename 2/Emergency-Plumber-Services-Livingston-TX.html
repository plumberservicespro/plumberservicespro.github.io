<p>This might seem like a joke, but it's really major if you wish to really get the most out of your financial investment. Start by requesting for a copy of the plumbing inspection list. If you're getting a rough-in or last inspection on a construction task or remodel, you can do a little online research so you can make final modifications before inspection day. Failing a checkup can suggest undesirable delays in your task.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been recently used and you've replaced the flapper, the issue may be larger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its capability to seal appropriately, creating waste and a higher water costs.</p>
