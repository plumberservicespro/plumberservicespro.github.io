Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
