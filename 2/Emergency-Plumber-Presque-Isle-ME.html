Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
