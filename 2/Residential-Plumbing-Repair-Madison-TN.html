<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most construction contractors (or their employees).

This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
