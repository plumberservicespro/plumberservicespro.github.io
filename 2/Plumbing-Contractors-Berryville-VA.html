Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>
