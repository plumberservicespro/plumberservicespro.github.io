Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Reduced to TAC, this approach utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline form that will not cling to surfaces.
