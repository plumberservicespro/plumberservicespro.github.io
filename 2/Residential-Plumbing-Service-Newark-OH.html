<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable service, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
