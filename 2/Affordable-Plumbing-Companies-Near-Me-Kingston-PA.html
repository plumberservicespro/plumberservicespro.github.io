<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule, such models are practical.</p>
