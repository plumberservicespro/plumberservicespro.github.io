<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.

When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
