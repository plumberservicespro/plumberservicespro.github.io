It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
