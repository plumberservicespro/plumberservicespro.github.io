<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in joists, floors, and studs. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
