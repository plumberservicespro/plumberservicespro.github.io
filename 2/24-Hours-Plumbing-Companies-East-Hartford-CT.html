<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies East Hartford CT</h3>
<p>Malfunctioning plumbing and components can be more than a problem: It can cost you cash in increased water expenses and trigger structural damage to your home. 10 percent of houses nationwide have leakages in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Epa. Repairing those leaks can save you 10 percent on your water bills each year.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow.
