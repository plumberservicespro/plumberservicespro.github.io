<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I have actually consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
<h3>Bathtub Repair in Somerville Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The kind of brand-new sink you can pick may be limited by the existing kitchen or bathroom base cabinet and the existing type of sink and existing countertop - particularly if don't want a full remodel. All-in-one sink and counter top combinations can be used to replace bathroom sinks on a single vanity cabinet without stressing over the existing sink or counter top. The plumbing professional can suggest what kind of sink would fit best.</p>
