<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complicated than replacing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to think about. A completely various disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink adapter needs to be puttied into place. A secure seal is a must.
