The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
