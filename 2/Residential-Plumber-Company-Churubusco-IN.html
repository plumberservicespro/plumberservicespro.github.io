As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you must most likely not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils.
