The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
