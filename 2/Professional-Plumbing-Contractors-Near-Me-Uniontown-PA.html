<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.

The clearing of stoppages in component branches; the repairing of incidental leaks in components, pipes or valves; or the elimination and reinstallation of existing or brand-new plumbing fixtures, residential type plumbing devices, non-testable backflow gadgets, and plumbing appurtenances; offered that such repairs do not need the replacement or include of hidden piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or fixtures.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a homeowner.
