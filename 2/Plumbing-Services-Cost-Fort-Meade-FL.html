<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
