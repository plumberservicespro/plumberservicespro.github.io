<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
