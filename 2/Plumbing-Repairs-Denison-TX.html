While gas designs are less costly to operate, they do require an existing gas line. The price of an electric hot water heater is normally lower, but it can be more costly to operate. Electric varieties are also easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>

Local plumber estimated rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I inspected around. Under the sink, place a container or pan underneath the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe.
