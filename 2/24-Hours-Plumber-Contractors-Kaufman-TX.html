<p>Don't put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It's important to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and obstructions - consider composting or putting these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can cake and collect in your drain also. After finishing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve.

<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
