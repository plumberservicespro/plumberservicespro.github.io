<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
