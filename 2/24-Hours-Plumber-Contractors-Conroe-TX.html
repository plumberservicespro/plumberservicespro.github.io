<p>Almost all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not.

Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
