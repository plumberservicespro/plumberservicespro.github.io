<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
