<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>

For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, allowing it to flow backwards into city water supplies.</p>
