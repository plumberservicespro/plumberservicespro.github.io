Galvanized steel (typically recognized just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively costly, and hard to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely long lasting and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively used pipe material for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
