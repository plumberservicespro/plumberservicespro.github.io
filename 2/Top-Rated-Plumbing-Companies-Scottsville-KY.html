<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both.

<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, plans for each device to be installed should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might use up to three weeks or more to process and approve. Rejected strategies must be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, most of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a property owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to meet or go beyond the state requirements and carry the responsibility for enforcing them.</p>
