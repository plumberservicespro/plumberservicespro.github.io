It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to locate and total easy repairs, so consider that with the cost when trying to manage the problem by yourself. The factor a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain underneath the toilet can likewise be the cause.
