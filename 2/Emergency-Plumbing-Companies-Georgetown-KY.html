<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Georgetown KY</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
