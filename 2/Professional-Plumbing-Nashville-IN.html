<p>Backflow is a possible problem in a water supply since it can spread out infected water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or possible connection between the public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can permit contaminants or impurities to enter the safe and clean water supply. Sickness can result from consuming water that has actually been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
