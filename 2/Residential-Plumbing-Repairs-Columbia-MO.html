As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes likewise lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually.
