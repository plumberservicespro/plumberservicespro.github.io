When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be inspected to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
