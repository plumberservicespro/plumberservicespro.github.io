<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the option is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is needed to fix the issue. Other times a more comprehensive option is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Inspecting the condition, water, and age lines to the hot water heater can help plumbers comprehend lots of things, including water pressure and indications of leaks.
