<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible solution, especially when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
