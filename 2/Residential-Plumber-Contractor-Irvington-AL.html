<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to offer years of defense. There are many local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water turbidity, temperature level or quality can all trigger the assembly to deteriorate in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are fixed on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>
