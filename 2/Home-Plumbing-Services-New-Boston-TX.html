When your drains are clogged, you will probably begin to observe gurgling noises, water backing up into your sink or shower, or odd smells. Drain obstructions are caused by wear and tear or a build-up of things we put down the drain gradually and as we understand, they can cause major plumbing problems.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, particularly when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
