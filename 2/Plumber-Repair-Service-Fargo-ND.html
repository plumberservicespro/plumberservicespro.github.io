<p>Installing a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will normally vary from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe required. If you're converting your home to gas, or if the present line is at capacity, expect to invest $2,000 or more. New gas line costs include home appliance connections, shut-off valves, a gas meter, and connection of the gas to the main gas line in the street.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
