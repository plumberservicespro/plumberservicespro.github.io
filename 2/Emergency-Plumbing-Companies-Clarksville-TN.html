<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Clarksville TN</h3>
<p>The most effective method to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You hear water running or leaking in the tank. When water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow occurs. The water flowing in reverse from a cross-connection might infect the drinking water system. Yard watering systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs are common cross-connection points.
