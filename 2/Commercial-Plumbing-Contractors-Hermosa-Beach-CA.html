<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
