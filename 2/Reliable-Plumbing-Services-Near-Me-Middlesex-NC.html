Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating rust Co2 will possibly contribute to the formation of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
