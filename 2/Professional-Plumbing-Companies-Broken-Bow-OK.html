The water is continuously heated up as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated if the tap is immediately switched off. The heating temperature level is typically pre-set to suit your preferences and needs. Due to the fact that they just heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
