If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
