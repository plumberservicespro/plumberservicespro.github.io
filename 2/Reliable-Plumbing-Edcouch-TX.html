A toilet's tank is made up of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
