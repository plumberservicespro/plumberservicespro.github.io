Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
