I chose this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
