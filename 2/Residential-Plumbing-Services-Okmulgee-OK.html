It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.
