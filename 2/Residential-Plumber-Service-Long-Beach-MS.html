<p>You are accountable for changing the assembly or fixing within 30 days if your assembly stops working the annual test. All replacements need to be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right type of assembly based upon the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see area listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly needs to satisfy the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be terminated until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with known backflow devices on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
