<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
