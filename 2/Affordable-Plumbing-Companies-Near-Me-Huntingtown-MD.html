More convenient homeowners might want to take on garbage disposal problems by themselves. However, if you want to guarantee a precise repair or installation, call our licensed plumbers for help.</p>
<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a various design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into place. A protected seal is a must. When linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to safeguard the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the appliance. Each location where you will have a gas device must have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anyone who sets up gas piping on residential or commercial property not under their ownership should have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require an authorization and inspection.</p>
