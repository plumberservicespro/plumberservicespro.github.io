<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
