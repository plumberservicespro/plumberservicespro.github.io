Instead, our specialists use a breaking tool that requires the existing pipeline to burst" and break apart.

This repair approach is generally used to replace the old pipe with a comparable or bigger pipe.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can occur gradually from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates inside of pipes. As a clog becomes larger with time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes properly.
