<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
