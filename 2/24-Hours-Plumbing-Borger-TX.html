<p>Examine the house's hot water heater You will be aiming to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and offered for use. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious indications of deterioration, demand that a new one be installed.</p>
<p>This is extremely crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system.
