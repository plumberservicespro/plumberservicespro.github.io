<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be installed need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might use up to three weeks or more to process and approve. Rejected plans must be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>

<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, however if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger issue to examine. You might need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is reasonably brand-new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing details. Inspect the list of state licensing companies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Though it's not always essential, sometimes the plumber may need to update or repair wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+.

Contact our professionals to figure out the extent of the issue.</p>
