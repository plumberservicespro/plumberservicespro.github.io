<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Plaquemine LA</h3>

Some electrical understanding is needed to make sure the wires are detached properly. Response: No! They do not have a lawn sprinkler, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
