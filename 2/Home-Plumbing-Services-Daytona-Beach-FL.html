<p>We recommend that property owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber a minimum of when per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running smoothly.

<p>The source or location of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a long lasting surface and a reliable stopper system.

The twist-and-drop design is much easier to use however needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
