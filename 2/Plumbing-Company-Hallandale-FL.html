<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
