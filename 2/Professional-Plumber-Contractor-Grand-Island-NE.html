<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>

Tough water causes these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to worry about any concerns with mineral deposits staying. This makes chores easier and less irritating for everyone involved.</p>
