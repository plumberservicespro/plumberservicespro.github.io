<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
