<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's concealed; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in floors, studs, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
