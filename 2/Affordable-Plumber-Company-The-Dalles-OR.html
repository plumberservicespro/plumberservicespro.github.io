<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
