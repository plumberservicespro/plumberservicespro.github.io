<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
