Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
