<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there need to be no problem in getting most of the waste through.

Another pointer to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
