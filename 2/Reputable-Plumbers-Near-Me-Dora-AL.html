<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it.

<p>Numerous homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their clogged or dirty drain issues.

The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
