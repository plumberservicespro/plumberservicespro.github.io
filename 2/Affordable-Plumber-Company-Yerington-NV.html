<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Yerington Nevada</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
