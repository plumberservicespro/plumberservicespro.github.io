<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Bonney Lake WA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
