<p>Your storm drains don't go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is normally transported somewhere else to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be susceptible to blocking because there simply isn't enough a high adequate flow to flush out the debris.</p>
