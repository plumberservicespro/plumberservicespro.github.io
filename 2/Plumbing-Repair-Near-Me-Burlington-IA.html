Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will establish. Sometimes the solution is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is required to solve the issue. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through.

Another pointer to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
