<p>Backpressure may occur when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not appropriately secured.</p>
<p>A normal whole-house repipe can take anywhere from three to five days, depending upon the size of the house, the number of levels it has and the picked pipe product. During a repipe, plumbers will make tactical cuts in the drywall, completely replace the pipes, re-install the removed drywall and spot it to erase any indications of damage or alteration to your home.</p>

New meters need to satisfy regulations and code requirements for their positioning, and gas providers may need a special meter for their services, limiting your options. Design - Once you add a second floor and even third floor, pipes need to be added to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive.
