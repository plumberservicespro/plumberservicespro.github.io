<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
