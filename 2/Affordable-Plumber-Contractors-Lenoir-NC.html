In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
