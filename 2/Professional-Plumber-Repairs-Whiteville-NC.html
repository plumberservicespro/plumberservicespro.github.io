<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company supplies consist of check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel designs), and minimized pressure zone assemblies.

When you attach the P-trap, also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
