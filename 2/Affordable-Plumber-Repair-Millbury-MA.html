Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
