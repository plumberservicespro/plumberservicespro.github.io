<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>Very first consider your alternatives if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak. A complete sewer pipe replacement may not be essential.
