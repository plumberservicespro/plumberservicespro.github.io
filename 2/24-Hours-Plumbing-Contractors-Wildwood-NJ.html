<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
