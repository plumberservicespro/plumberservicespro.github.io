<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or sometimes potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
