<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Because they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regrow after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
