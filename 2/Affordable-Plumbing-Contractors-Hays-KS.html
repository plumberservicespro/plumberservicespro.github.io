<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Hays KS</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working effectively. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
