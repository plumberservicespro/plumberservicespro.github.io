<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
