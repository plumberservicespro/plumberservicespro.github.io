You do not need a plumbing permit for simple repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing license is issued as part of a larger residential structure authorization or commercial building authorization.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>If you have a waste disposal unit, you can try disposing a tray of ice down the drain, and after that turn on the waste disposal unit while running water. This will knock off any food debris stuck in the disposal, and the salt will scrub it as well. Leaking kitchen faucet, bathroom faucet, laundry faucet or tired, broken sink? No issue is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our skilled plumbing group finishes the job rapidly and economically.</p>
