<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
