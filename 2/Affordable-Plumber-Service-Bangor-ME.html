<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Except for domestic pump and pump and watering systems, accreditation is not needed to install plumbing systems outside of a building (e.g., water lines connected directly to municipal water mains, sewer line connections, and so on).
