Property owners can just loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method, water pressure can likewise be low.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids pollutants or impurities from being drawn into the drinking water system. Numerous scattering systems already have the proper backflow preventer set up and need just be checked each year. Others may not meet state and local policies and might need to be changed with the appropriate backflow preventer.</p>

If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem could spread significantly.
