<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
