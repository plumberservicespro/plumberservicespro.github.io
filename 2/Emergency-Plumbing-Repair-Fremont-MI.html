<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without needing to completely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Daily usage must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you ought to wait up until after the cycle is completed and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings. You ought to also examine to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
