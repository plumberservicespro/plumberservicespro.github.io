<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
