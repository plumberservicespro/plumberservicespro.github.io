<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.
