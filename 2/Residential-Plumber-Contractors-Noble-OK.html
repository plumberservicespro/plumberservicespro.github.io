<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
